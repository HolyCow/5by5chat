**2013-10-18T17:28:55+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** ecc1977: Three short paragraphs. Intro, benefit to company, enthusiastic yet concise follow-up.  
**2013-10-18T17:29:23+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** ecc1977: I mean wrap-up, with contact info and enthusiasm about following up in an interview.  
**2013-10-18T17:29:39+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** ecc1977: DONE. I hate seeing kids fresh out of college who write cover letter essays.  
**2013-10-18T17:29:40+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Sorry. One of the classes I teach is an internship seminar and another is a seminar for writers getting ready to submit their work and it's crucial to keep the cover short for both those sets of students.  
**2013-10-18T17:29:58+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Anyway, the sorry is for me just shouting out advice!

**2013-10-18T17:32:21+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** danbenjamin: Recruiters at big tech companies do that ALL THE TIME. Three different font faces, colors, and sizes. Inconsistent spacing. Argh.  
**2013-10-18T17:33:07+00:00** - **&lt;vopt&gt;** Isn't it counterproductive to point out these obvious mistakes? They help you weed out the unwanted resumes.  
**2013-10-18T17:33:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Because that's EXACTLY what I want.

**2013-10-18T17:39:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haddiebird  totally acceptable to have like a nice serif for headers and sans serif for content

**2013-10-18T17:40:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** No Objective? :)  
**2013-10-18T17:40:48+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** haddiebird: It kinda depends on the company/role. Some recruiters have encouraged me to format things differently for their internal preferences.  
**2013-10-18T17:41:01+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** theTiger: Ugh :)  
**2013-10-18T17:41:11+00:00** - **&lt;haddiebird&gt;** jbecker yes if done correctly.

**2013-10-18T17:42:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** God I hate objectives  
**2013-10-18T17:42:11+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** and went back to school at a different college?  
**2013-10-18T17:42:48+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I feel like a cover letter/introductory email should provide clarity on "objective"

**2013-10-18T17:44:34+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I've never put my first college on a résumé... if I failed out, I don't think it should go on there  
**2013-10-18T17:44:46+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** so you get the two colleges I went to (AA and BA) and graduated from  
**2013-10-18T17:48:23+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Richard_A I think that makes sense. In the end, the resume is marketing, and you get to pick and choose what you include so that it paints you in the best light.  
**2013-10-18T17:49:09+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** But the things you guys are calling for would annoy many non-you hiring managers. THey'd find that excessive.  
**2013-10-18T17:49:16+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** I had a job for 3 months at the beginning of 2010 that I don't include at all. I still had a side-job at the time, so there's no 3 month gap without the short-lived job, so why include it?  
**2013-10-18T17:49:46+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** I agree that knowing if someone uses Google Docs is helpful, but soooo many folks out there will request the exact opposite, and be super annoyed if you state your proficiency with different software or suites. It varies a lot.  
**2013-10-18T17:50:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Depends on the job Virginia. Because if somewhere I'm applying to looks at my tech skills is wondering if I can use Google Docs I don't want to work there I"m not a good fit  
**2013-10-18T17:50:27+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Because they're talking about entry level stuff wiht a lot of office adminsitration style work  
**2013-10-18T17:50:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** administration*

**2013-10-18T17:51:28+00:00** - **&lt;haddiebird&gt;** Tuftee?  
**2013-10-18T17:51:38+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** No real need for more than one font. Here's another strong case for doing everything—including your resume—in plain text or Markdown and then exporting it into Word if necessary.  
**2013-10-18T17:51:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I can do a better job with white space with a subtle difference in complimentary fonts  
**2013-10-18T17:51:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** than like bold and huge  
**2013-10-18T17:51:59+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** hahaha thanks Dan  
**2013-10-18T17:52:05+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** It's VERY corporate.

**2013-10-18T17:52:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** But readability is very opinionated

**2013-10-18T17:52:37+00:00** - **&lt;haddiebird&gt;** i spelled it right

**2013-10-18T17:52:50+00:00** - **&lt;haddiebird&gt;** got all the books

**2013-10-18T17:53:06+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** nice. I still don't own them, they're great books though.  
**2013-10-18T17:53:38+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Richard_A looks fine to me. I could use a bit more white space since you run to the second page anyway  
**2013-10-18T17:53:45+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: True. But you have to have a good enough vibe for the company to cater to them. (At Amazon, for example, any fancy em dashes or bullet points will get converted to garbled HTML anyway.)  
**2013-10-18T17:53:49+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** jbecker: noted.  
**2013-10-18T17:54:12+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Virginia: yup  
**2013-10-18T17:55:45+00:00** - *Richard_A is sufficiently ashamed*  
**2013-10-18T17:58:15+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** my resume is 4 pages  
**2013-10-18T17:58:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but that's standard for my position  
**2013-10-18T17:58:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** even short  
**2013-10-18T17:58:27+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** So, if you're not proud of the college you flunked out of or the job that didn't work out, why should you include that?  
**2013-10-18T17:59:50+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** ecc1977: Right. I mean, if I worked somewhere for a week... it's not really going on there, right?  
**2013-10-18T17:59:53+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** I'm not talking about lying.  
**2013-10-18T18:00:03+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I worked at a place for two nights, part time. Should I put that on the résumé  
**2013-10-18T18:00:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** different fields  
**2013-10-18T18:00:39+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I don't think I should.  
**2013-10-18T18:01:16+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** I'm talking about relevance and about resume length. One of the reasons I don't include that three-month job is that it would spill my resume onto a 3rd page. And it's not relevant.  
**2013-10-18T18:01:25+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: Well put  
**2013-10-18T18:02:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I think "gaps" shouldn't really be there-- there should be clarity what's happened the last 5 years  
**2013-10-18T18:02:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I shouldn't look at this and wonder  
**2013-10-18T18:02:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** What happened for 2 years there?  
**2013-10-18T18:04:12+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Absolutely agree with that.  
**2013-10-18T18:05:09+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** Oh, Dan, you underestimate people. If you're applying to a crappy employer, they will absolutely use that knowledge to lowball you.  
**2013-10-18T18:05:14+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** I mean you overestimate them.  
**2013-10-18T18:05:16+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** danbenja_ haddiebird what do you think about when people say "competitive" or "commensurate with experience" etc. I find that frustrating when I was seeking a job. If there's a real ballpark, or in most cases, even worse, there is a real dollar amount I don't like that we both might be wasting our time because they don't want to be open.  
**2013-10-18T18:05:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I don't understand why an employer, when there is a number, wouldn't just provide it  
**2013-10-18T18:06:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** The goal is not to be a stooge, Virginia.  
**2013-10-18T18:06:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** !s Turn Your Marco Nose Up  
**2013-10-18T18:06:55+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: Exactly! Like, when you're in a crappy desperate position, you're going to wind up applying to the wrong jobs with people who don't have that integrity,.  
**2013-10-18T18:07:03+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** !s It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp  
**2013-10-18T18:07:20+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I refuse to take another telemarketing job. I'd rather starve.  
**2013-10-18T18:07:27+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I'd rather be homeless than cold call.  
**2013-10-18T18:07:42+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** And there's a whole gendered element to this; even if you try to sort of emulate male negotiation tactics as a woman, there are many folks out there who won't receive that well from a female candidate.  
**2013-10-18T18:07:48+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** This is just such a broad topic, ugh. :)  
**2013-10-18T18:08:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** My response is generally (if true) I want to be here. But I have to be honest, if that's the number and there's no flexibility and there aren't opportunities for short term growth I won't be able to make a long term commitment to you  
**2013-10-18T18:08:14+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** Yeah, and this age thing is true too; pretty much whenever you see someone who doesn't list the year of their graduation, it makes me think they're concealing it to avoid ageism.  
**2013-10-18T18:08:20+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Richard_A I'd like to refuse things, but when my family is without health insurance (including my two kids) and we're constantly trying to find a way to pay bills on time... I want to have integrity and only go for the things I love to do, but sometimes that's not practical.  
**2013-10-18T18:08:37+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** ecc1977: True. I've got the luxury of not having kids.  
**2013-10-18T18:08:42+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** and not being married.  
**2013-10-18T18:09:01+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I have had friends that I admire who will directly include in the initial conversation this is my expectation if that's not where you're at let's not even schedule an interview  
**2013-10-18T18:09:06+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** As it is, I'm trying to stick with my teaching, my writing, and this Geek Force Five publication, but sometimes I really miss the money that came from my part-time retail job that ended in August.  
**2013-10-18T18:09:27+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** Part-time retail I'd do.  
**2013-10-18T18:09:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** But I've never been in such a solid position that I cna just say-- not enough details this sounds great if I can make what I think I'm worth  
**2013-10-18T18:10:06+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** You know, that was only a couple hundred bucks a week. I should be able to find that elsewhere. And, if I did, I'm sure I could pay for insurance. But I haven't figured out how to get my thing (Geek Force Five) to bring in that much money a week.  
**2013-10-18T18:11:51+00:00** - **&lt;JustJeff&gt;** Yes abusive relationship sounds about right  
**2013-10-18T18:12:53+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** JustJeff: Yeah, this whole episode reminds me how grateful I am to be out of those abusive relationships.  
**2013-10-18T18:13:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** !s You Want to Work Here...  
**2013-10-18T18:13:59+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** danbenja_: You're not wrong, but I guess I just think you represent a very different type of employer and company. And the bulk of your stoogey trapped callers aren't in relationships with someone like you, haha.  
**2013-10-18T18:14:29+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Richard_A part-time retail, at least part-time retail that pays you well, often requires a lot of flexibility, bordering on open availability. That's the major downside. You end up having to plan your life around your part-time job.  
**2013-10-18T18:14:50+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** ecc1977: I follow. I used to work two jobs: one full, one part-time

**2013-10-18T18:15:10+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** For the last two years, I taught nearly full-time (without full-time benefits) and worked part-time retail.  
**2013-10-18T18:15:19+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** 12 hour days...  
**2013-10-18T18:15:25+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** 52 hour week.  
**2013-10-18T18:15:31+00:00** - **&lt;scottnelle&gt;** !s Calls!  
**2013-10-18T18:15:35+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** ooh, is it too late to call? Probably. :)  
**2013-10-18T18:15:59+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: I got the exact same thing from Apple! And Amazon, and Microsoft, and Nuance... again, that's super corporate.  
**2013-10-18T18:16:24+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: Dang, you went somewhere different. I got the opposite experience.  
**2013-10-18T18:16:40+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Virginia yeah stooge jobs are tough about this stuff  
**2013-10-18T18:16:54+00:00** - **&lt;scottnelle&gt;** Hey Virginia!  
**2013-10-18T18:17:02+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ey Virginia!  
**2013-10-18T18:17:41+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** that really backfired, huh Dan?  
**2013-10-18T18:18:35+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I was about to say there's guys who do that too. (Myself included. :/ )  
**2013-10-18T18:18:38+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** that's a little normative  
**2013-10-18T18:18:59+00:00** - **&lt;justmarmar&gt;** I've had the experience of being hired from within, just out of school. How do you ask for more if you don't know what an average pay range is in an area that varies?  
**2013-10-18T18:19:04+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** interviews suck  
**2013-10-18T18:19:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I hate being the only one in the room who knows what he's doing  
**2013-10-18T18:19:27+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** justmarmar: Uh... research it first?  
**2013-10-18T18:19:31+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** I don't know.  
**2013-10-18T18:19:46+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** glassdoor.com justmarmar  
**2013-10-18T18:19:56+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** check surrounding cities too  
**2013-10-18T18:20:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and their target market cities </lifehack>  
**2013-10-18T18:20:46+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** I tried to be fast for the rest of y'all!  
**2013-10-18T18:20:51+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** ecc1977: Yay!  
**2013-10-18T18:20:59+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** danbenja_: don't feel bad. I'll call in next week. Or, will try.  
**2013-10-18T18:21:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you were, shortest call in history  
**2013-10-18T18:21:08+00:00** - **&lt;Topher&gt;** Virginia - what's your site?  
**2013-10-18T18:21:17+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** dropping off hold.  
**2013-10-18T18:21:18+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** virginiaisforlovers.com  
**2013-10-18T18:21:31+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** totes awesome yo ;p  
**2013-10-18T18:21:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I threw in that "make next week all calls" just for you jackals  
**2013-10-18T18:21:43+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** REPRESENT  
**2013-10-18T18:21:56+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** scottnelle: Hi hi!  
**2013-10-18T18:21:58+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** hey this is my Mile smiley   Z;P  
**2013-10-18T18:21:59+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** AlbatrossD: And hi to you too!  
**2013-10-18T18:22:22+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** virginia topher wants to know your site  
**2013-10-18T18:22:25+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** http://theheartographer.com/ is my site; sorry; I'm playing Chatroom Catch-up  
**2013-10-18T18:22:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and so I trolled him....  
**2013-10-18T18:22:31+00:00** - **&lt;Topher&gt;** AlbatrossD - That's NOT Virginia's site. LOL  
**2013-10-18T18:22:39+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** topher: Haha nope :)  
**2013-10-18T18:22:43+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Virginia i saw an article on selfies today and thought of you  
**2013-10-18T18:22:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you should bid for it  
**2013-10-18T18:22:53+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** jbecker: Nice! I wrote one of those, ya know.  
**2013-10-18T18:23:00+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I resisted the urge to talk to Virginia due to the holding calls  
**2013-10-18T18:23:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** for YOU, jackals  
**2013-10-18T18:23:11+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** AlbatrossD: It's a little out of my range! The stupid state claims all the good usernames and URLS. But I got @va on app.net.  
**2013-10-18T18:23:21+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: Awww, you're a peach, Moises!  
**2013-10-18T18:23:36+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** good guy Moiseschiu, doin' it for the jackals  
**2013-10-18T18:23:42+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I was going to go political and mention the fact the US still has no Federal-level Equal Pay Act  
**2013-10-18T18:23:43+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** Jackal discount, guys. Just saying. Dented Meat licensed me a logo and everything.  
**2013-10-18T18:24:03+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** moiseschiu: Yeah, I know. A lot of women know. :) It's a good point.  
**2013-10-18T18:24:10+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I don't think I would have you help me cheat on my wife  
**2013-10-18T18:24:14+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the UK's Equal Pay law is decades-old enough that there are movies about it  
**2013-10-18T18:24:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** can I pass my discount on to a friend?  
**2013-10-18T18:24:35+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** AlbatrossD: Nah, but you can still refer your single pals, haha. I break up no marriages! Sure, make sure he mentions you.  
**2013-10-18T18:24:37+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** or she.  
**2013-10-18T18:24:53+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** Nice to hear your voice on here again, Moises!  
**2013-10-18T18:24:59+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** he's a Tern, don't hold that against him  
**2013-10-18T18:25:14+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu very happy you're back on the 5by5.  
**2013-10-18T18:25:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** other than Critical Path  
**2013-10-18T18:25:23+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Hey, in the spirit of spreading the word, here are three download codes for the Geek Force Five ibooks thing I just put out: TAHWL34FMXXF X47T7WYHAHRW MJYRX3NJ7W3M  
**2013-10-18T18:25:24+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** which I listen to live, of course  
**2013-10-18T18:25:27+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Like a gentleman  
**2013-10-18T18:25:33+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** Bye Dan! Bye Haddie! Bye Moises! Bye Jackals!  
**2013-10-18T18:25:44+00:00** - **&lt;Richard_A&gt;** Bye kids.  
**2013-10-18T18:25:46+00:00** - **&lt;Virginia&gt;** ha, aaaand we're done!  
**2013-10-18T18:25:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I feel bad for not knowing where Moises was  
**2013-10-18T18:25:54+00:00** - **&lt;Topher&gt;** Thanks, gang!  
**2013-10-18T18:25:58+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** now to get back to the 17 things I was doing  
**2013-10-18T18:26:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** no one knew where I've been  
**2013-10-18T18:26:24+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Moises, this is the first Quit! so I have a lot in my que to listen to  
**2013-10-18T18:26:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** in weeks, not ever  
**2013-10-18T18:26:45+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** You guys are awesome, by the way. It gets lonely in the home office sometimes and this helped make my afternoon.  
**2013-10-18T18:26:47+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I did one a while ago with joel  
**2013-10-18T18:27:00+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Your misses didnt make you take a regular job did she?  
**2013-10-18T18:27:32+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I've actually sent out a bunch of résumés, and got nothing  
**2013-10-18T18:27:58+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** for a while, I could have supported a paying gig and the production, but now I'm in the thick of making the thing  
**2013-10-18T18:28:10+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** The Thing!  
**2013-10-18T18:28:19+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** moiseschiu: Bummer, man (about the resumes). Glad to hear that your making a thing, though. Making things is fun!  
**2013-10-18T18:28:27+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** *you're  
**2013-10-18T18:28:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** just going through the process again reminded me how much I would hate it  
**2013-10-18T18:28:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** better steeled resolve  
**2013-10-18T18:29:11+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** You moderated Kevin Conroy twice, I'm surprised people aren't knocking on your door  
**2013-10-18T18:29:12+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Amen to that. It's why, despite Dan's advice, I'm going to keep trying to get by on the one job (teaching) while I work on Geek Force Five.  
**2013-10-18T18:29:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** AlbatrossD: there are those who would love for me to do a ton of work for the pleasure of doing the work, and not money  
**2013-10-18T18:30:10+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Oh right. Money.  
**2013-10-18T18:30:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu seems rampant in a lot of creative/production fields  
**2013-10-18T18:30:32+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** moiseschiu: Do you think pleasure of doing work and money have to be mutually exclusive? I hope not, but I'm always afraid they might be.  
**2013-10-18T18:30:37+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I make enough money at my stooge job, they are very nice to me and like what I do, and I'm miserable  
**2013-10-18T18:30:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** so...  
**2013-10-18T18:30:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** ecc1977: the guy who would direct Hustle & Flow and the Footloose remake worked for years in a Barnes & Noble, even after he started making movies  
**2013-10-18T18:31:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu you get to touch my glorious art and say you were a part of it isn't that all you need? You and your wife are supposed to eat the exposure I provide you with for dinner.  
**2013-10-18T18:31:12+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Dat "waitin' for payday" feeling  
**2013-10-18T18:31:32+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I pay rent with my public admiration  
**2013-10-18T18:31:47+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** AlbatrossD: sometimes, it's a matter of finding a hobby or interest that makes you not resent the work in a vacuum  
**2013-10-18T18:32:09+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I knew people in Tallahassee who worked State jobs that weren't oppressive, just boring  
**2013-10-18T18:32:10+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** oh no, I have a side gig, I feel good when I'm doing it  
**2013-10-18T18:32:23+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** moiseschiu: And maybe that's the point. The reasons I ditched the part-time retail job instead of near full-time teaching job (their schedules conflicted, which is why I had to make the choice) is that I wanted nights and weekends free for family and creative pursuits like my theater and book projects. But sometimes I think I'd be better off with the benefits and paycheck from the retail gig (which was at Apple).  
**2013-10-18T18:32:26+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** State employment. Been there.  
**2013-10-18T18:32:26+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** doing musical theatre was like moonlighting as a superhero for them  
**2013-10-18T18:32:34+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** haha  
**2013-10-18T18:32:43+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** good for them, really what is the difference?  
**2013-10-18T18:32:56+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you put on a costume and take on a new persona for the greater good  
**2013-10-18T18:33:14+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it's a matter of what satisfies you, not some outsized version of what you think makes you happy rather than what actually makes you happy in practice  
**2013-10-18T18:33:43+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** My honest to goodness end game is to get to my current salary but doing 60% time or so somewhere. I want to trade success for "leisure" but for me "leisure" will mean experimenting with lots of other work. I love what I do but I seem to be too antsy to just do one thing.  
**2013-10-18T18:34:01+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: it's more like "be a regular correspondent/content generator, and we'll maybe/kinda/possibly pay you down the line"  
**2013-10-18T18:34:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** yuck  
**2013-10-18T18:34:24+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "Share of the business"  
**2013-10-18T18:34:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** also, "please give us all your famous friends' email addresses and phone numbers. my sister thinks Rian Johnson is HAWT"  
**2013-10-18T18:34:32+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "Great exposure"  
**2013-10-18T18:34:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu doesn't everyone love Rian Johnson?  
**2013-10-18T18:34:58+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "We're just starting out and our product is in concept. You would be paid based on sales generated"  
**2013-10-18T18:35:07+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "Profit share"  
**2013-10-18T18:35:15+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I love it when people volunteer themselves to be the source of my misery for the low, low compensation of free  
**2013-10-18T18:35:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I don't understand why people would work jobs where they can't understand how they are producing value  
**2013-10-18T18:36:04+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** There was a CLientsfromhell craigslist ad: Developing a calendar for sale, need 12 pieces of original art and copy"  
**2013-10-18T18:36:19+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Compensation: based on sales  
**2013-10-18T18:36:20+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** just because how do you know what you're worth? And for all Dan jokes about job security, if you can't figure out how what you does results in revenue you really have 0  
**2013-10-18T18:36:25+00:00** - **&lt;ecc1977&gt;** Thanks, everyone, for the chat.  
**2013-10-18T18:36:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I'm still friendly with him, but Harry Knowles really set an AWFUL standard  
**2013-10-18T18:36:40+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** anytime ecc1977  
**2013-10-18T18:36:58+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** taught the entire internet you could raise a massive traffic site on the back of free labor  
**2013-10-18T18:37:03+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** "Write for your webpage that gets no visitors and has really bad ads no one clicks and lose all the rights to my own work and thoughts?"  
**2013-10-18T18:37:52+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and all the "me too" sites that have followed him have almost across-the-board employed the same "free work to maybe hire if you're friends with or sleeping with the right person"  
**2013-10-18T18:38:03+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** yeah it's not good.  
**2013-10-18T18:38:15+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** side note, I hope you're using Amazon referral on Arthouse Cowboy  
**2013-10-18T18:38:22+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** HitFix, however, does not run any unpaid work  
**2013-10-18T18:38:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Yoiu almost have to self publish an eBook to make money writing anymore  
**2013-10-18T18:38:31+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: oh hell yes  
**2013-10-18T18:38:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** ~s Bobba Fett Without A Hat  
**2013-10-18T18:38:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and even then... come on it's an eBook  
**2013-10-18T18:38:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Referral links are my favorite way to support a lot content  
**2013-10-18T18:39:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you make money on referral links?  
**2013-10-18T18:39:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** it's clean-- I'm interested in something, you're telling me about it, I want to get it, you should get a part of that  
**2013-10-18T18:39:36+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I know it's not much… but it's so much better than ads  
**2013-10-18T18:39:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: I even have an Amazon UK referral account  
**2013-10-18T18:39:39+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and so much more money than ads  
**2013-10-18T18:39:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I hate ads  
**2013-10-18T18:39:49+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu special for imyke  
**2013-10-18T18:39:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I don't even see them anymore  
**2013-10-18T18:39:55+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** The Deck must be really good cuz that's all I see on Merlin's  
**2013-10-18T18:39:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** not necessarily because of adblocking  
**2013-10-18T18:40:15+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but I just don't look. And because I have no "purchasing intent" it's exceptionally rare I see something even relevant  
**2013-10-18T18:40:20+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** had i more time, I'd be more strongly pushing the tech industry linked list style of posting, sponsoring, and presenting Arthouse Cowboy  
**2013-10-18T18:40:23+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** (note… I think this is not true with audio and video content)  
**2013-10-18T18:40:31+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: no, I actually import a ton of UK Blu-rays  
**2013-10-18T18:40:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** being who you are....  
**2013-10-18T18:40:52+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** last year alone, I imported every single Ozu Collection DVD or Blu-ray set sold in the UK  
**2013-10-18T18:41:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** banner ads are dead to me and the world  
**2013-10-18T18:41:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** <blink>  
**2013-10-18T18:41:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** there are ad buys to be had, but the tradeoffs (site takeovers, forced auto play video, etc) are not worth it  
**2013-10-18T18:41:48+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** TRY AND PUNCH THE MONKEY AND WIN $100  
**2013-10-18T18:41:55+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and the mega-sites that are jacks of many trades and masters of none are in decline and dying  
**2013-10-18T18:41:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** oh god the autoplay video  
**2013-10-18T18:42:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** oh god  
**2013-10-18T18:42:00+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** UGO, IGN  
**2013-10-18T18:42:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Trying to read Slate or Salon tells you everything you need to know about ads online.  
**2013-10-18T18:42:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Especially the mobile versions… *shudders*  
**2013-10-18T18:42:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu your uber post on like the 100 best blurays  
**2013-10-18T18:42:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** shoudl really be an ebook  
**2013-10-18T18:44:58+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** protip, pitch webdev to people with autoplay videos on their business websites  
**2013-10-18T18:45:18+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** they are starting to realise it's driving customers awway  
**2013-10-18T18:45:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: one of the things that's been on my list of "things to find time for" is to do just that, fully reformat  
**2013-10-18T18:46:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I don't think I did a 100 best list, but I did a massive Best of 2012 thing  
**2013-10-18T18:46:19+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** that's what i meant  
**2013-10-18T18:46:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** the one that crashed browswers  
**2013-10-18T18:46:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** because I refuse to believe in multi-paging an article  
**2013-10-18T18:46:47+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** with a bimodal distribution of visit time of like 10seconds and 45mins  
**2013-10-18T18:46:56+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** this time around, I have the benefit of handy-dandy Squarespace galleries  
**2013-10-18T18:47:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ugh. multi paging  
**2013-10-18T18:47:53+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** hey moiseschiu, newsletter?  
**2013-10-18T18:48:01+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** subscription?  
**2013-10-18T18:48:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** arthouse cowboy premium app?  
**2013-10-18T18:48:26+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I don't have time for any of those things, but do I want them, yes  
**2013-10-18T18:48:44+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the movie is one of two Big Things  
**2013-10-18T18:49:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the second is a publication I won't have time to work on until next year at earliest  
**2013-10-18T18:49:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Exciting, I hope it all goes somewhat smoothly  
**2013-10-18T18:49:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** all I need is more time and more money  
**2013-10-18T18:50:25+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** for the twelve of you still in here, the movie is a documentary about a Texas politician  
**2013-10-18T18:50:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu we guessed  
**2013-10-18T18:50:36+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** or at least some of us jackals  
**2013-10-18T18:50:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yes.  
**2013-10-18T18:50:40+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Have strongly suspected  
**2013-10-18T18:51:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Perhaps a certain candidate for governor in the mold of Ann Richards (sort of)?  
**2013-10-18T18:51:29+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** that I was hoping would already be public, but I'm playing it safe because I know there are a bunch of people who think they're making the same movie  
**2013-10-18T18:51:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** but they haven't been shooting for three months, they've all just started  
**2013-10-18T18:51:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu you were on the scene when it mattered  
**2013-10-18T18:52:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and Drobo/Transporter look to be supporting us in the form of equipment  
**2013-10-18T18:52:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Sweet. :)  
**2013-10-18T18:52:20+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and I've secured footage no one else can get  
**2013-10-18T18:52:35+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I have a followup with one of their guys about that today (I hope)  
**2013-10-18T18:52:42+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Drobo/Transporter  
**2013-10-18T18:52:46+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** i just want to know  
**2013-10-18T18:52:52+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Please make Texas a better place. :D  
**2013-10-18T18:52:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Will there be at least 20 mins of how Robert's Rules work  
**2013-10-18T18:52:59+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** ROFL!  
**2013-10-18T18:52:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** because that one guy was fucking awesome  
**2013-10-18T18:53:14+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the Transporter as a remote footage-sharing device is a godsend compared to Dropbox or Yousendit or an FTP  
**2013-10-18T18:53:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That was one of my favorite nights in recent memory. :)  
**2013-10-18T18:53:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** (as a former state employee and current condo board president etc I am too familiar with said rules)  
**2013-10-18T18:53:47+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker: Kirk Watson? the Senator who knew his Rules like the back of his hand?  
**2013-10-18T18:53:49+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Piling onto The Texas Tribune to try to figure out what the heck was actually going on.  
**2013-10-18T18:53:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Yes  
**2013-10-18T18:53:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Kirk Watson is the name  
**2013-10-18T18:54:21+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I've known Senator Watson since 2008, when I was delegation chair for Williamson County to the State Convention  
**2013-10-18T18:54:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** btw's: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/texastribune/livestreaming-the-2014-race-for-gorvernor?ref=home_location  
**2013-10-18T18:54:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I just want him to grow an epic mustache more befitting of my image of a Texan  
**2013-10-18T18:54:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and then I want him to talk about Robert's Rules  
**2013-10-18T18:54:43+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** for 35 mins  
**2013-10-18T18:54:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** theTiger: indeed, everyone should support that  
**2013-10-18T18:54:47+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'd buy that fo ra dollar  
**2013-10-18T18:55:26+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** whether or not they live in Texas, it sets a standard so that other state legislatures can been seen from an internet connection away doing their misdeeds  
**2013-10-18T18:55:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the Tribune is backing my crew  
**2013-10-18T18:56:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the guy whose UStream was up when the Tribune feed went down?  
**2013-10-18T18:56:12+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** we finally got live internet video of our general assembly this year  
**2013-10-18T18:56:34+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I'm friendly with him too  
**2013-10-18T18:57:14+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and I've very carefully made myself and my crew known to a lot of interest groups that would be interested in what we're doing  
**2013-10-18T18:57:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** moiseschiu sounds like the start of something rela big  
**2013-10-18T19:00:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I hope so  
**2013-10-18T19:01:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** speaking of kickstarters people should back (but unfortunately it will not fund) http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publicresource/public-safety-codes-of-the-world-stand-up-for-safe  
**2013-10-18T19:09:50+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** catch you later jackals  
**2013-10-18T19:11:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Bye Moisés.  
**2013-10-18T21:15:56+00:00** - **&lt;david_&gt;** well  
**2013-10-18T21:58:21+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** well well
