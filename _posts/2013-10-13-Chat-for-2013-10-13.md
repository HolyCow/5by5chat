**2013-10-13T00:04:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** btw: http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Weekend/  
**2013-10-13T00:04:44+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Great film. :)  
**2013-10-13T00:06:29+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** This is not taking me to a movie page.  
**2013-10-13T00:07:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Let me try again.  
**2013-10-13T00:08:18+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Weekend/70178273  
**2013-10-13T00:09:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Oh, quiesce... Watched Upside Down today.  
**2013-10-13T00:10:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** OK  
**2013-10-13T00:10:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The opening VO got things started off poorly and I don't think the film ever fully recovered. >.>  
**2013-10-13T00:10:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** The concept is also ridiculous.  
**2013-10-13T00:11:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yeah, that didn't help much either.  
**2013-10-13T00:11:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Never really got away from the "This is a poor sci-fi knock-off of Romeo and Juliet" either.  
**2013-10-13T00:12:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Romeo and Juliet with  happy ending that negates its premise?  
**2013-10-13T00:13:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yep.  
**2013-10-13T00:13:55+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I look forward to the sequel where their hybrid child can bend gravity to her will and uses this power to free and unite the peoples of both worlds.  
**2013-10-13T00:14:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** There can be an invading force of brown people from a thrid world with some on asinine wacky gravity mechanic.  
**2013-10-13T00:14:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** ^some other  
**2013-10-13T00:15:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Also, does Jim Sturgess ever play anyone other than the dewy eyed paramour?  
**2013-10-13T00:15:41+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Cloud Atlas is ... borderline.  
**2013-10-13T00:16:53+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm not sure I even remember his role... Was he the young musician who had his music stolen?  
**2013-10-13T00:20:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** He was several people, none of which were that completely different-looking young, lithe British man!  
**2013-10-13T00:20:39+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** lol. :)  
**2013-10-13T00:21:21+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** He was primarily the 18th-century abolitionist and the Neo Seoul rebel guy.  
**2013-10-13T00:21:41+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Okay. I'm picturing him better now.  
**2013-10-13T00:22:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Wasn't a huge fan of that film, so my memory of it is poor.  
**2013-10-13T00:22:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** He was the guy everyone made racist comments about to prove how racist they aren't and how racist the film is.  
**2013-10-13T00:23:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That film was my "Avengers", by which I mean it quickly made a billion dollars in my heart, but which I ... have no idea what I mean.  
**2013-10-13T00:24:36+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :)  
**2013-10-13T00:25:23+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It needed a lot more Zhou Xun, though.
