**2013-10-07T13:31:04+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Good morning Jackals.  
**2013-10-07T13:32:15+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow1&gt;** What is so good about it?  
**2013-10-07T13:32:21+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow1&gt;** Err, I mean hi.  
**2013-10-07T13:33:00+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I've had many many worse Mondays than this Monday. (So far, at least.)  
**2013-10-07T13:35:14+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** _HolyCow: We've finally got DeployStudio and Munki up and running to satisfaction. So yes, it's a good morning/afternoon indeed  
**2013-10-07T13:35:52+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** DeployStudio. :) So many wonderful uses.  
**2013-10-07T13:37:33+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I wish I had the time to be able to keep our restore images current. :(  
**2013-10-07T13:37:54+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Plus, Apple gave us lots of new problems when iLife went AppStore only. >.>  
**2013-10-07T13:38:08+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** I heard some are investigating getting automated restore-images from Apples Recovery-Repository…  
**2013-10-07T13:38:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Now wouldn't that be nice… <.<  
**2013-10-07T13:38:57+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** theTiger: Mavericks might ease those problems  
**2013-10-07T13:39:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** For single-site management, yes.  
**2013-10-07T13:39:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** But, we're a service department. :D  
**2013-10-07T13:40:53+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** How do you admin AppleIDs and MacAppStore licenses?  
**2013-10-07T13:41:20+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** http://blogs.marketwatch.com/energy-ticker/2013/10/04/move-over-russia-u-s-is-now-the-worlds-biggest-oil-gas-producer/  
**2013-10-07T13:41:22+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!  
**2013-10-07T13:41:22+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** !usa  
**2013-10-07T13:42:04+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Internally, we have a single AppleID that we use with the volume purchasing program and our demo product. For our customers, the shortest answer is that we don't.  
**2013-10-07T13:42:53+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** theTiger: Sounds like how we do it. We use a single AppleID for deployment and buy a f*ck load of redeem-odes that we never redeem..  
**2013-10-07T13:43:16+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** we don't have VPP here…  
**2013-10-07T13:44:38+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** _HolyCow: That's not the development that Kyoto like to see  
**2013-10-07T13:45:24+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** What's her problem?  
**2013-10-07T13:45:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm sure that OPEC is thrilled as well.  
**2013-10-07T13:48:33+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Also I think the process for getting oil from shale causes groundwater pollution.  But it is worth it to beat the commies!  
**2013-10-07T13:59:20+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Dynamic_Nuclear_Generation_System  
**2013-10-07T14:10:30+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Extruded Plastic Dingus. You know… for kids!  
**2013-10-07T14:10:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :D :D :D  
**2013-10-07T14:10:58+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** transform wikis, always funny stuff  
**2013-10-07T14:11:06+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** transformER  
**2013-10-07T15:05:48+00:00** - **&lt;danbenjamin&gt;** ok  
**2013-10-07T15:05:51+00:00** - **&lt;danbenjamin&gt;** who wrote shewbot?  
**2013-10-07T15:06:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** As I understand it, _HolyCow did.  
**2013-10-07T15:13:53+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** danbenjamin: yes it was me  
**2013-10-07T15:14:08+00:00** - **&lt;danbenjamin&gt;** msg me your phone number please thnx  
**2013-10-07T15:15:41+00:00** - *theTiger plays dramatic music.*  
**2013-10-07T15:58:43+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks-afk&gt;** https://twitter.com/5by5craft/status/387245486488682496  
**2013-10-07T17:59:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The Frequency will start soon. I have to leave to pick up some stuff.  
**2013-10-07T19:00:01+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The News 160 with @imyke - http://t.co/kTShD7UjEy (57 seconds ago)  
**2013-10-07T19:02:09+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Pacifically speaking, Freq started at 9AM today/  
**2013-10-07T19:02:16+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** dammit  
**2013-10-07T19:06:50+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So they just didn't tweet it?  
**2013-10-07T19:09:56+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I don't think it has happened today  
**2013-10-07T19:15:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, they're in New York this week, right?  
**2013-10-07T20:22:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** So, to ask a stupid question: Did The Frequency end up recording today?  
**2013-10-07T20:23:37+00:00** - **&lt;vscra&gt;** I never got any notification on the iOS or Mac app so I doubt it  
**2013-10-07T20:43:02+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** no  
**2013-10-07T20:47:31+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Unless they did it in secret.  
**2013-10-07T20:47:37+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** The Secrecy  
**2013-10-07T20:47:44+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Are they in NYC yet?  
**2013-10-07T20:48:00+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Lemme check by Ben and Patty tracker.  
**2013-10-07T20:48:09+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** beep! beep! beep!  
**2013-10-07T20:48:35+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** not getting a good reading  
**2013-10-07T20:48:41+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** too much interference in here  
**2013-10-07T20:49:10+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I'll try boosting the power  
**2013-10-07T20:49:42+00:00** - *theTiger increases the Flash Gordon noise and flicks more science-y stuff around.*  
**2013-10-07T20:49:47+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Nothing.  I've giving it all she's got.  
**2013-10-07T20:55:38+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** We need more blinking buttons.  
**2013-10-07T21:18:00+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Ever seen a skeleton doing standup?  
**2013-10-07T21:18:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** No.  
**2013-10-07T21:18:30+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** It's humerus.  
**2013-10-07T21:18:36+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I hate you.  
**2013-10-07T21:20:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Do you know why spiders make the best comics?  
**2013-10-07T21:20:45+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I don't but I hope you'll tell me.  
**2013-10-07T21:20:54+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** They really have a leg up on the competition.  
**2013-10-07T21:21:48+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Did you hear about that cheese factory explosion in France?  
**2013-10-07T21:21:54+00:00** - *theTiger sets the chat room on fire.*  
**2013-10-07T21:22:03+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I did not!  
**2013-10-07T21:22:06+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Nothing left but de brie.  
**2013-10-07T21:24:19+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Oof, you really are a munster.  
**2013-10-07T21:24:42+00:00** - *theTiger writhes with pain.*  
**2013-10-07T21:25:18+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Speaking the French: What a cuisine. Do you have any idea what the idea of a duck smells like?  
**2013-10-07T21:25:29+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** ^inside of a  
**2013-10-07T21:25:46+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The inside of a duck?  
**2013-10-07T21:25:53+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Yes.  
**2013-10-07T21:25:59+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** No.  
**2013-10-07T21:28:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That, btw, was The Internet telling you to stop. ;-)  
**2013-10-07T21:28:41+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** That one was so bad, I was disconnected.  
**2013-10-07T21:28:46+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks-afk&gt;** god, Comcast makes me want to die  
**2013-10-07T21:29:05+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks-afk&gt;** speaking of disconnected. Internet out for almost eight hours now.  
**2013-10-07T21:30:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** theTiger: :|  
**2013-10-07T21:30:55+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** That reminds me. What did the farmer say to the cow?  
**2013-10-07T21:30:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Dojo time for me… Bye. :)  
**2013-10-07T21:31:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** but  
**2013-10-07T21:31:17+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I... don't think that's what he said, theTiger...  
**2013-10-07T21:32:52+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Well, this is awkward.  
**2013-10-07T21:57:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** what's he say?  
**2013-10-07T21:57:12+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** slowpoke.jpg  
**2013-10-07T21:58:05+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** AlbatrossD: Something about begging for the puns to stop. Subverting expectation for theTiger's benefit.  
**2013-10-07T22:24:45+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I need a separate window for irc  
**2013-10-07T22:24:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** i mean monitor  
**2013-10-07T22:25:20+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Lizards don't like IRC.  
**2013-10-07T22:28:29+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** are you drunk?  
**2013-10-07T22:28:45+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** or was that from V I can never tell  
**2013-10-07T22:28:58+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** V?  
**2013-10-07T22:29:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** A monitor is a type of lizard.  
**2013-10-07T22:29:41+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** oh that was a stretch my friend  
**2013-10-07T22:30:06+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** but you are correct, based on growin up in San Diego and all my filed trips involved some sort of Zoo or Aquarium  
**2013-10-07T22:30:16+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** field not filed  
**2013-10-07T22:30:26+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** might as well be typing on a cash register  
**2013-10-07T22:30:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I always make sure to file my trip reports.  
**2013-10-07T22:30:49+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** That's how you get reimbursed  
**2013-10-07T22:31:10+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I could spell reimbursed with a rubiks cude  
**2013-10-07T22:31:25+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** but not simple words like cube to save my life  
**2013-10-07T22:32:47+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** With the way things are going, a rubik's cube keyboard may not be far off.  
**2013-10-07T23:08:45+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** anyone dreaming of the 90s?  
**2013-10-07T23:08:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** go to http://sollercomposites.com/  
**2013-10-07T23:08:55+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** No.  
**2013-10-07T23:09:02+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** one at a time please  
**2013-10-07T23:09:06+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you might crash it  
**2013-10-07T23:10:57+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** or don't I'm a dird not law enforcement  
**2013-10-07T23:11:01+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** BIRD  
**2013-10-07T23:11:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** DAMN FREAKING DELL Keyboard  
**2013-10-07T23:11:48+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you had it SO RIGHT 3 generations ago mimicking the IBM keyboards  
**2013-10-07T23:11:53+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** where did you stray?  
**2013-10-07T23:12:58+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I was quite fond of my IBM keyboard. 1999-2006 RIP.  
**2013-10-07T23:13:16+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** It's like the people building it were typists or something  
**2013-10-07T23:13:30+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** remember when people who used computers designed them as well?  
**2013-10-07T23:14:20+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** a non IT friend told me at dinner last night she had to explain to someone what a SHIFT key did  
**2013-10-07T23:14:39+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** When people didn't think anything more than 300USD for a desktop was expensive?  
**2013-10-07T23:15:18+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I don't entirely understand how that is possible.  
**2013-10-07T23:15:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** My wife's parents bought their first PC at Costco for $2300  
**2013-10-07T23:15:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I bult my first one for $650  
**2013-10-07T23:16:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and 4 hours on the phone with my ComputorEdge  
**2013-10-07T23:16:10+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** When I was younger I was saving up for my first notebook. It was 5k+ and I never made it.  
**2013-10-07T23:16:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** NEVER would have gotten a laptop!  
**2013-10-07T23:16:27+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I DREAMED of it  
**2013-10-07T23:16:40+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Rather, my first computer which would have been a notebook.  
**2013-10-07T23:16:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I saw Hackers and I was like "HOW CAN THEY AFFORD THIS THEY HAVE NO MONEY!"  
**2013-10-07T23:16:50+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Space was at a premium.  
**2013-10-07T23:17:22+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** my family had a doble-wide and we owned the space  
**2013-10-07T23:17:25+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** so there  
**2013-10-07T23:17:59+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** A what?  
**2013-10-07T23:18:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** a dubble wide  
**2013-10-07T23:18:47+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** a dribble side  
**2013-10-07T23:18:54+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** a drinker, snide  
**2013-10-07T23:19:10+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Is this it? Am I having the stroke right now?  
**2013-10-07T23:19:12+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I was making a colloquial reference to a mobile home  
**2013-10-07T23:19:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** a mobile home with two units attached down the middle  
**2013-10-07T23:19:40+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** thus: Double-Wide  
**2013-10-07T23:20:14+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "Thems the fancy new family, They got themselves a double-wide" *spit into spitoon  
**2013-10-07T23:20:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** A sort of boxy house? Some of the google image results just look like "normal" houses.  
**2013-10-07T23:20:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Anyway, I get the idea.  
**2013-10-07T23:22:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Actually, without the slightest idea how many people were in your family, that doesn't tell me anything. Oh, right, birds are fairly small.  
**2013-10-07T23:23:19+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** In reality, we have a series of poles off the coast we perch upon  
**2013-10-07T23:23:40+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** for safety reasons, the location of the nest is secret, but I haven't returned since leaving  
**2013-10-07T23:23:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** as you do  
**2013-10-07T23:24:31+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Space wasn't a problem, my brother and I could have build a server in 1991 and had plenty of room  
**2013-10-07T23:24:38+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** it was just the money  
**2013-10-07T23:24:49+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** The last bird I knew that migrated between a series of poles made good money doing so.  
**2013-10-07T23:25:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think you're thinking of that Anne Margaret looking girl off second  
**2013-10-07T23:25:19+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** she could do better  
**2013-10-07T23:27:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Anyway, as a child we had a shared desk in the hall so a computer of my own was an awkward proposition. Having any sort of computer was a bit unrealistic, I was just suffering a boat of design lust.  
**2013-10-07T23:27:53+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I was oo young to understand such things.  
**2013-10-07T23:28:13+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** A bout, rather. I don't suffer boats gladly.  
**2013-10-07T23:31:01+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I like sailboats  
**2013-10-07T23:31:41+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I don't understand why, even in adulthood, people don't have a dedicated workstation  
**2013-10-07T23:32:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** In what sense?  
**2013-10-07T23:33:46+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** There are people running their business from "Their kitchen table"  
**2013-10-07T23:34:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** And I think kids should learn how to manage a desk of their own to develop workflow  
**2013-10-07T23:34:35+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Large flat surface? Not everyone has the space or money for anything else?  
**2013-10-07T23:34:51+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** what is okay to leave on my desk until tomorrow, what isn;t et cetera  
**2013-10-07T23:35:01+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Sounds reasonable  
**2013-10-07T23:35:14+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I like the Ikea Small Spaces videos  
**2013-10-07T23:35:51+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** yard sales, lumber  
**2013-10-07T23:36:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** those kids from MIT who build furniture from newspaper  
**2013-10-07T23:36:40+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I understand it can be hard to attain things, I just think it's a serious consideration  
**2013-10-07T23:37:16+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I am watching it now. This looks like "my apartment in Oslo: the web series".  
**2013-10-07T23:37:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** yeah!  
**2013-10-07T23:37:51+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I like small space web videos  
**2013-10-07T23:38:05+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think I have too much space, my wife likes to fill it  
**2013-10-07T23:38:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Large mostly empty rooms make me uncomfortable.  
**2013-10-07T23:41:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** Even this manages to have racist comments.  
**2013-10-07T23:41:48+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ?  
**2013-10-07T23:42:01+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQjBrt9LriY  
**2013-10-07T23:45:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** wrong because the black guy doesn't steal their laptops  
**2013-10-07T23:45:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** where is the racism?  
**2013-10-07T23:46:31+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I didn't even see a black. Does that mean I win or lose the "I'm not racist" game?  
**2013-10-07T23:47:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I hate that "I don't see color/race" thinf=g  
**2013-10-07T23:47:34+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** my Auntie married a black man because she wanted to, not becasue she was blind to the fact he was black  
**2013-10-07T23:48:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** I hate it in the "look how not racist I am!" sense, sure.  
**2013-10-07T23:49:29+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I see what you are talking about, the Comments Section. I thought you meant in the video  
**2013-10-07T23:49:40+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I can't see what set this guy off  
**2013-10-07T23:51:18+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I hate how the comments are organized  
**2013-10-07T23:51:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I subscribe to SpacesTV  
**2013-10-07T23:52:50+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce`&gt;** This stuff is especially fun if you are willing to design and build your own furniture.  
**2013-10-07T23:53:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ah yeah  
**2013-10-07T23:54:12+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** we have Habitat for Humanity reStores here, all kinds of recycled materials  
**2013-10-07T23:58:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** well. Leaving my stooge job now. Catch ya later
