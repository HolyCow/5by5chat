**2013-09-13T00:23:25+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Hello, "friend".  
**2013-09-13T00:24:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Ouch. :(  
**2013-09-13T00:25:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** How are you this evening?  
**2013-09-13T00:26:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I was without power for much of the day due to weather and ruralness, so I am feeling internet hungry.  
**2013-09-13T00:26:29+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh, understandable. That's one annoying thing about this town. The power never goes out. >.>  
**2013-09-13T00:27:03+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I don't mind power loss and loads or rain when I have someone to share it with.  
**2013-09-13T00:27:16+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** ^loads of  
**2013-09-13T00:28:39+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That's fair. Though, to be honest, that's never happened to me.  
**2013-09-13T00:28:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I am listening to IA and reading twitter.  
**2013-09-13T00:29:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Yeah? You should look into that.  
**2013-09-13T00:29:25+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** T'would be nice; last time the mate was out of town when the snow storm hit.  
**2013-09-13T00:29:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** IA interesting? I only caught the tail end live.  
**2013-09-13T00:30:05+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I enjoy Andy too much for it to not be.  
**2013-09-13T00:31:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Depends what kind of mood he's in and what the topic is for me. :D  
**2013-09-13T00:39:20+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** http://i.imgur.com/5LHyqi7.jpg  
**2013-09-13T00:39:34+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Tea -20 minutes  
**2013-09-13T00:40:26+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Tea sounds good.  
**2013-09-13T00:40:57+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** False tea makes no sound  
**2013-09-13T00:41:14+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I sense that I may soon be reading a wiki about "odinforce".  
**2013-09-13T00:41:48+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I think you mean "O, the force"  
**2013-09-13T00:42:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** You may be thinking of the Q contunuum.  
**2013-09-13T00:43:59+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I think you mean Q branch.  
**2013-09-13T00:44:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you're thinking of Vesper.  
**2013-09-13T00:44:47+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** You may be thinking of my Vespa.  
**2013-09-13T00:45:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It goes "beep beep", much like Roderick's house.  
**2013-09-13T00:47:07+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I'm about to climb up on the bed to change a light blub.  If jbecker shows up for jackal chat and I'm not here, let him know I'm probably dead or in the hospital.  
**2013-09-13T00:47:50+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Get someone to stablise you by holding your butt.  
**2013-09-13T00:47:53+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker broke the headphones with mic that he uses to record. Did you get his tweet?  
**2013-09-13T00:49:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** https://twitter.com/jasonpbecker/status/378306839974539264  
**2013-09-13T00:52:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Sad times.  
**2013-09-13T00:52:36+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** eh  
**2013-09-13T00:53:46+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** So I put that light bulb in for nothing.  
**2013-09-13T00:53:53+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Thanks Obama.  
**2013-09-13T00:54:10+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Perhaps, but good work on not dying or maiming yourself.  
**2013-09-13T00:54:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Indeed.  
**2013-09-13T00:54:59+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** There is always a chance the glass will fall off  
**2013-09-13T00:55:18+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Try to sit clear of the splash radius.  
**2013-09-13T00:56:39+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Hard to know.  It will probably bounce on the bed once.  Who knows where it will go then.  
**2013-09-13T00:57:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** We should get together and model this to be sure. We can't risk losing even one jackal.  
**2013-09-13T00:59:27+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** ♪ Because every Jackal is sacred, every Jackal is great. If a Jackal is wasted, the gods get quite irate. ♪  
**2013-09-13T01:02:08+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Hmm, practice guitar, do some javascript, or borderlands 2.  
**2013-09-13T01:06:13+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** In theory, I have some people who will drag me into Tina's Dungeon whatsits at some point.  
**2013-09-13T01:06:45+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep"  
**2013-09-13T01:08:07+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Playing it right now on Ultimate.  Sucks solo.  
**2013-09-13T01:08:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Refresh my memory re what "ultimate" is.  
**2013-09-13T01:09:04+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Finish the game twice. All enemies are your level or higher.  
**2013-09-13T01:09:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That is the lv 50ish one, yes?  
**2013-09-13T01:10:40+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Yep.  I'm level 58 now.  
**2013-09-13T01:11:20+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I think my character was 50.  
**2013-09-13T01:12:06+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I just got a retweet and a favourite. I may have to Quit!™ twitter while I am ahead.

**2013-09-13T13:39:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** 5C anyway. >.>

**2013-09-13T13:45:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Oh wow. :/  
**2013-09-13T13:45:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm glad whoever has a good sense of humor about it.

**2013-09-13T15:02:08+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** evening everyone  
**2013-09-13T15:02:32+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** love what apple introduced on the 10th, excellent market strategy. Leverage IOS platform.  
**2013-09-13T15:03:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** crucial to spread the standard iOS7-able hardware that fits the form factor they want  
**2013-09-13T15:04:00+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Morning, rather  
**2013-09-13T15:05:32+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** You want a quality ecosystem, malware free, fast, stable and with excellent features like iCloud backup, find my found, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iPhoto, iMovie, Siri, iCloud integration, richest app store, the most content in terms of music, tv-show,movies, audiobooks,magazines, etc. You have to pay the admission price.  
**2013-09-13T15:05:54+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Well, yeah. Obviously.  
**2013-09-13T15:05:59+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Everyone knows that by now.  
**2013-09-13T15:06:22+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** To get into this ecosystem with a new phone, you´ll have to pay $545.  
**2013-09-13T15:07:55+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** iPhone 5C has mass-appeal, it´s low-cost in that it cost less to produce, and will increase Apples profit margin. Brilliant strategy by Apple by launching it as the main phone, it´s the one you see on www.apple.com and it´s the only one you can pre-order. It´s the one they make the most selling in term of profit margin %. It´s simply brilliant strategy by Tim Cook. I´m surprised Wallstreet doesn´t see this, and still obsess with mar  
**2013-09-13T15:08:34+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** IOS platform has nothing to worry about, Android platform is not close to competing about experience and value.  
**2013-09-13T15:08:54+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** heh  
**2013-09-13T15:09:12+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** I'd say it's pretty damn close  
**2013-09-13T15:09:12+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** even though iCloud is a big bag of hurt  
**2013-09-13T15:09:35+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** iOS is more refined, and has a better selection of apps  
**2013-09-13T15:09:49+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** moiseschiu, iCloud works flawlessly for me. iMessenger on the other hand...  
**2013-09-13T15:09:54+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** but you can do pretty much everything you can on Android that you can on iOS  
**2013-09-13T15:10:00+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** there are plenty of entertaining games  
**2013-09-13T15:10:29+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** and then there are things Android can do that iOS simply can't because iOS is more locked down  
**2013-09-13T15:10:54+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Hydr: I still have it overwriting my contacts twice a month or so  
**2013-09-13T15:11:50+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** moiseschiu, not had that issue here luckily though - no doubt though that they have to work really hard on improving services stability compared to Google.  
**2013-09-13T15:12:13+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** ChrisLTD: You can do pretty much everything, other than make money if you're a dev  
**2013-09-13T15:12:17+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** luckily on IOS though I´m able to chose which services I decide to use  
**2013-09-13T15:12:27+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I generally find iCloud mostly works  
**2013-09-13T15:12:56+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** truemarmalade: experience and value as a consumer  
**2013-09-13T15:13:00+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** but it's a bag of hurt in that devs don;t trust it enough to use Core Data across the board  
**2013-09-13T15:13:05+00:00** - **&lt;rdm_&gt;** <Hydr>, I agree. Great strategy. Focus the pre-order on the 5C, get more data on this model and no distractions from the 5S... the 5S will sell really well 19 out of 20 people I know will upgrade to 5S right away...(12 of them have the 5)...  
**2013-09-13T15:13:19+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** cloud saving in games, DropBox-killing, and so on  
**2013-09-13T15:13:40+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** moiseschiu: If every game used icloud saving, that'd be epic.  
**2013-09-13T15:13:45+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** ChrisLTD, I´ll agree that for the most part you will find more or less the same apps and games on Android. But I would disagree with the user experience. I do use both ecosystems, and in my opinion it´s sub-par on many levels with IOS  
**2013-09-13T15:14:09+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** Hydr: I agree, but I think it's "close"  
**2013-09-13T15:14:38+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** The phone Apple is proud of is without a doubt the 5S, it really is a forward thinking phone. But there is little doubt that the phone Apple wants to sell is the 5C.  
**2013-09-13T15:15:02+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** it's a lot like OpenOffice vs. Microsoft Office  
**2013-09-13T15:15:43+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** yes MS Office was and has been better, but Open/LibreOffice caught up close enough  
**2013-09-13T15:16:25+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** There was one major leap in technology on the 10th, and it was the fingerprint sensor on the 5S. I am fairly sure that this is the one feature that the competition will have problem replicating successfully, and it´s such a vital part of Apples future roadmap.  
**2013-09-13T15:17:37+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** 64bit, M7, improvements to the camera etc were great additions, but fingerprint/biometric technology has proven extremely hard to solve, there have been many many attempts but they are all suffering from the same type of problems. Apples approach appear to address those issues perfectly, but time will tell.  
**2013-09-13T15:18:13+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** I hope they did a good job, but I don't think it's an earth shattering addition to the platform  
**2013-09-13T15:18:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Hydr: I think touchID also solves a potential pain point down the road in iOS8…theoretically supporting multiple user accounts on iOS  
**2013-09-13T15:18:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** replace "potential" with "existing"  
**2013-09-13T15:19:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** on a semi-related tangent: there were Surface/WinPhones all over the season premiere of popular US show The Mindy Project  
**2013-09-13T15:19:47+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** man… I don't think they are ever gonna do multiple user accounts  
**2013-09-13T15:20:01+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** unless it becomes a major selling point of Android  
**2013-09-13T15:21:25+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I think they absolutely do, at least for iPad  
**2013-09-13T15:21:32+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** Think I would have to agree with ChrisLTD on that part, too many data issues with sync´ing data. Not sure if Apple think multiple account is a problem worthy of solving.  
**2013-09-13T15:21:58+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** I think the iPad mini is their answer to multiple user accounts  
**2013-09-13T15:22:15+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** "buy more you cheap bastards" :-)  
**2013-09-13T15:22:38+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** ChrisLTD: agreed that the value proposition is usually: want multiple user accounts? spend a few hundred $$$ and get another  
**2013-09-13T15:23:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** but thinking about the emphasis on "future-looking" paired with the fact touchID supports multiple "people" profiles  
**2013-09-13T15:23:53+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** yeah, I hope they do it  
**2013-09-13T15:24:19+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** I'd even be fine if there was just a main and a guest account for people  
**2013-09-13T15:24:38+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** what will differentiate iPad from a larger-screen iPhone next year is driving it harder as post-PC laptop replacement  
**2013-09-13T15:24:39+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** I just don't like the idea of strangers or even other family members having access to my email account  
**2013-09-13T15:26:54+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** my big wish is still better communication between apps  
**2013-09-13T15:27:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** me too  
**2013-09-13T15:28:01+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I want TextExpander to be allowed to work across everything  
**2013-09-13T15:37:26+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** pen on paper too  
**2013-09-13T15:37:28+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** would be sweet  
**2013-09-13T16:05:30+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** heh  
**2013-09-13T16:05:55+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** sounds like a great idea to me  
**2013-09-13T16:06:22+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** really look forward to the first 5C sales numbers  
**2013-09-13T16:06:44+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** if it matches the iPhone 5 weekend sale number, that would be great news for Apple  
**2013-09-13T16:10:23+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I'M SO SORRY YOU GUYS  
**2013-09-13T16:10:33+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** >:O  
**2013-09-13T16:11:14+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** So angry right now  
**2013-09-13T16:11:19+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** ^_^  
**2013-09-13T16:13:09+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I'm having tacos for dinner today, people!  
**2013-09-13T16:13:20+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Delicious bliss  
**2013-09-13T16:13:23+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** You are dead to me for the next 10 minutes.  
**2013-09-13T16:20:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** KimRoen: What wizardry is this?  
**2013-09-13T16:21:50+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-13T16:22:15+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Going to watch the Star Trek movie as well  
**2013-09-13T16:22:16+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Kim, for posterity, would you mind shoving CP up there?  
**2013-09-13T16:22:56+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Of course! It wasn't in the schedule last I checked, but I see it was added now :)  
**2013-09-13T16:24:29+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Any opinions on ST:ItD?  
**2013-09-13T16:24:46+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** me?  
**2013-09-13T16:24:50+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Oh, "Into". "ST:ID", then.  
**2013-09-13T16:24:53+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Anyone :)  
**2013-09-13T16:25:07+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I liked it very, very much  
**2013-09-13T16:25:29+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I reject the notion that Roddenberry is akin to a God as its creator  
**2013-09-13T16:25:49+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** That's great! It was added to iTunes today, so I'll be watching it. It wasn't in cinemas over here  
**2013-09-13T16:26:13+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** making a movie the same as the series from the 1960s would be to make a show of that show's time  
**2013-09-13T16:26:27+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I'm surprised it wasn't available in the country of Europe.  
**2013-09-13T16:26:33+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** this is very much a Kirk, Spock, and Khan story of today, and especially post-9/11  
**2013-09-13T16:26:43+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Hah, I appreciate that _HolyCow.  
**2013-09-13T16:26:44+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** where are you again, KimRoen?  
**2013-09-13T16:26:54+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Norway  
**2013-09-13T16:28:42+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the main conflict entirely revolves around The Prime Directive and a battle over the nature of Starfleet itself  
**2013-09-13T16:29:16+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Do I need to have seen the previous one?  
**2013-09-13T16:29:24+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** here in the States, the Blu-ray release has been quite the debacle: http://arthousecowboy.com/journal/2013/9/10/star-trek-into-darkness-blu-rays-reviews  
**2013-09-13T16:29:26+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Because I haven't.  
**2013-09-13T16:29:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** you don't need to, no  
**2013-09-13T16:29:46+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Oh yeah, I noticed you talking about that on twitter  
**2013-09-13T16:29:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** No, but you may as well. I don't know anyone who liked one and not the other,  
**2013-09-13T16:30:00+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Okay, good to know  
**2013-09-13T16:30:44+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** How much is it to stream from iTunes in the US?  
**2013-09-13T16:31:05+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Into Darkness, that is  
**2013-09-13T16:31:17+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** $20 in HD to "buy"  
**2013-09-13T16:31:29+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** And rent?  
**2013-09-13T16:32:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I think standard $4/5 HD/SD  
**2013-09-13T16:32:10+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** Do you guys mostly buy or rent on iTunes?  
**2013-09-13T16:32:17+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Okay, interesting  
**2013-09-13T16:33:05+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** It's $30 to buy here, and $9 to rent  
**2013-09-13T16:33:47+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I normally rent, because I seldom feel the need to watch it again.  
**2013-09-13T16:33:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I redeem tons of codes, but when I actually spend money, it depends. I almost always rent.  
**2013-09-13T16:34:26+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** but would behave differently if extras feature sets were more identical to discs and actually worked on iDevices  
**2013-09-13T16:34:59+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I would probably buy more movies on iTunes if I could buy at a discount after renting  
**2013-09-13T16:35:33+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** me too  
**2013-09-13T16:35:34+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** What movies do you guys buy?  
**2013-09-13T16:35:58+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I need to leave now, but thanks for the advice, moiseschiu and quiesce  
**2013-09-13T16:36:06+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** KimRoen: Do you have Netflix or HBO?  
**2013-09-13T16:36:11+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I have Netflix  
**2013-09-13T16:36:35+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** Netflix in Norway has a very poor selection of content  
**2013-09-13T16:36:45+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yeah, unfortunately  
**2013-09-13T16:36:46+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** vs. the US version of Netflix  
**2013-09-13T16:36:50+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** Så det er sagt :-)  
**2013-09-13T16:36:58+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Jepp, jepp  
**2013-09-13T16:37:29+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** quiesce: Did you have anything you wanted to recommend? :)  
**2013-09-13T16:37:42+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Yes, HBO. :P  
**2013-09-13T16:38:21+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Oh, I see ^^  
**2013-09-13T16:38:26+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** as an indie filmmaker, my first choice for go to market would be iTunes - I like their business model over Netflix  
**2013-09-13T16:38:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I know nearly nothing or your tastes, so I wouldn't feel confident in any recomendation.  
**2013-09-13T16:39:07+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I tend to agree with Faith, if that says anything  
**2013-09-13T16:39:10+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** KimRoen, kjenner du Marcus Ramberg?  
**2013-09-13T16:39:53+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** KimRoen: Korpi? I haven't heard from her since she left the whatsits. I forget what show she was on.  
**2013-09-13T16:40:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Geek Friday. :)  
**2013-09-13T16:40:14+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Hydr: We have a lot of common friends, but don't know him personally.  
**2013-09-13T16:40:24+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Which seems to be a common source of Jackal dissent.  
**2013-09-13T16:40:30+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Before that, even.  
**2013-09-13T16:40:40+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** quiesce: Yes, Korpi! I really enjoy Geek Friday :)  
**2013-09-13T16:40:55+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** quiesce: Yes, she co-hosted a few shows with Dan in the beginning  
**2013-09-13T16:40:59+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I am happy for you.  
**2013-09-13T16:41:12+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** quiesce: And I am happy for you <3  
**2013-09-13T16:41:17+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh. :D  
**2013-09-13T16:41:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I'll give you something to be happy for me about!  
**2013-09-13T16:41:57+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** My health has been much improved this last week.  
**2013-09-13T16:43:09+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Oh, that's really great news!  
**2013-09-13T16:43:44+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I thought Faith was on The Daily Edition, but I can't seem to find any  
**2013-09-13T16:44:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I thought that was Christina Warren?  
**2013-09-13T16:44:24+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Dan and Faith did the early episodes of Geek Friday together.  
**2013-09-13T16:44:33+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** No, Jen Simmons joined Dan on that, but he did it by himself for a while  
**2013-09-13T16:44:38+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yeah, I know about that one  
**2013-09-13T16:45:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** According to the CMS, she appeared on one episode of The Daily Edition.  
**2013-09-13T16:45:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://5by5.tv/people/faith-korpi  
**2013-09-13T16:45:53+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** She joined an episode of The Comic Shack as well  
**2013-09-13T16:46:12+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** And an after dark of Back to Work  
**2013-09-13T16:46:18+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Did she produce with Dan for a while?  
**2013-09-13T16:46:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm trying to figure out why she would have been on those ADs.  
**2013-09-13T16:46:33+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yes, she was his producer for a few months  
**2013-09-13T16:46:54+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Haddie before Haddie  
**2013-09-13T16:47:01+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Heh, yeah :)  
**2013-09-13T16:47:35+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** This was right after he had moved to Austin: http://5by5.tv/dailyedition/72  
**2013-09-13T16:47:36+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Also http://5by5.tv/people/robot-haddie  
**2013-09-13T16:47:57+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Haha, awesome

**2013-09-13T16:48:18+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** http://5by5.tv/search  
**2013-09-13T16:48:36+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Phew, sent the secret link mere moments before dan joined  
**2013-09-13T16:48:49+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** One of the great features of the 5by5 CMS… The URL scheme just makes sense. :D

**2013-09-13T16:49:23+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** All right, enjoy the shows people! I'll be heading home now. Tacos and Star Trek!

**2013-09-13T16:51:13+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** People who enjoy this music would like Zircon I think, by the way  
**2013-09-13T16:51:15+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** http://open.spotify.com/album/5As6qcQALx6fny7M8ZyHQk  
**2013-09-13T16:51:21+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** theTiger, what did you think about the Apple event?  
**2013-09-13T16:51:27+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I do like Zircon!  
**2013-09-13T16:51:31+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I believe it is called "nerdsk".  
**2013-09-13T16:51:43+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** quiesce: I think you're thinking of snikt  
**2013-09-13T16:51:49+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think you  
**2013-09-13T16:51:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Hydr: Nothing terribly surprising. My big question is "Who is going to buy the 5C?".  
**2013-09-13T16:51:57+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** 're think ing of boof!  
**2013-09-13T16:52:04+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** theTiger: Your mom.  
**2013-09-13T16:52:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Thetiger why not 5c?  
**2013-09-13T16:52:08+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** theTiger: Boom.  
**2013-09-13T16:52:10+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I try not to. It hurts everytime, Rogue. Every time. :(  
**2013-09-13T16:52:35+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** The 5c are SO COLORFUL!!!  
**2013-09-13T16:52:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Mum hates tech. Getting her onto the iPad was difficult enough. She'll have a feature phone until she dies. :D  
**2013-09-13T16:52:46+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** heh  
**2013-09-13T16:52:56+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Underneath the jokes, there's feels.  
**2013-09-13T16:52:56+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** they sounded like they were adding vocals  
**2013-09-13T16:53:06+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** AlbatrossD: Yes, my eyes. They burnses.  
**2013-09-13T16:53:21+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I want a yello one with a red Croc case  
**2013-09-13T16:53:36+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Mustard and Catsup, get it>  
**2013-09-13T16:53:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Hot Dog Stand for AlbatrossD. ;-)

**2013-09-13T16:53:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Dolly Parton in 9 to 5  
**2013-09-13T16:53:52+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Old-timey Windows reference, I smell.  
**2013-09-13T16:54:06+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Even before

**2013-09-13T16:54:27+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** I think the vast majority of iphone customers don´t know much about tech, and they´ll see a new iphone in colors with a new IOS and jump at the first chance they get.  
**2013-09-13T16:54:49+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Mmm, the comfiest iPhone yet.  
**2013-09-13T16:54:51+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** more so than the 5S, which is a superior phone in every regard at a slightly higher price  
**2013-09-13T16:54:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Hydr: I think you're right. Makes the middle options more appealing.  
**2013-09-13T16:55:34+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Like used crocs?  
**2013-09-13T16:55:39+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Does that look clean to you?  
**2013-09-13T16:55:45+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** By the looks of www.apple.com you would think the 5C is the new new iphone and not the 5S, brilliant. :-)  
**2013-09-13T16:55:51+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I think the 5S is visually awkward. At this point, I would prefer to do away with the coloured panels entirerly.

**2013-09-13T16:57:09+00:00** - **&lt;Hydr&gt;** Very curious to see what sort of impact the 5C will have on Apples profit margin % on phones  
**2013-09-13T16:57:12+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** My mama don't dance

**2013-09-13T18:36:04+00:00** - **&lt;jwrightkustomz&gt;** Kerstin: If you look at the schedule you can click on your timezone and it will alter the times for you.  
**2013-09-13T18:36:09+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** theTiger: that's a reasonable assumption  
**2013-09-13T18:36:26+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and then add 45 minutes

**2013-09-13T18:41:21+00:00** - **&lt;Kerstin&gt;** that's quit not quite  
**2013-09-13T18:41:45+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** quite... teehee  
**2013-09-13T18:42:07+00:00** - **&lt;Kerstin&gt;** there is a british show somewhere out there called "quite" where people talk like the Queen  
**2013-09-13T18:42:22+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Is that a SImpsons joke?  
**2013-09-13T18:42:23+00:00** - **&lt;Transition&gt;** For the caller: the more you can put yourself INTO the space you want to be in, the better chance you have to be in that space PROFESSIONALLY.  
**2013-09-13T18:42:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I miss Shlok this is great  
**2013-09-13T18:43:11+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I would say to find any way to quit the second job, never eat out, eat rice and beans, and spend that time doing these things.  
**2013-09-13T18:43:14+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines&gt;** I'm calling Quit! but it's just ringing out, international callers just have to add a 0 at the beginning right?  
**2013-09-13T18:43:25+00:00** - **&lt;Shloky&gt;** Cool. Yup.  
**2013-09-13T18:44:08+00:00** - **&lt;Kerstin&gt;** ghostlines: it's like +1 for USA and then some mystery numbers. I could try skype calling in actually!

**2013-09-13T18:44:53+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** If I had four back to back clients right now, I would have to Quit or I would leave too much on the table  
**2013-09-13T18:44:59+00:00** - **&lt;Kerstin&gt;** re: caller - What about taking extra qualifications or getting some funding?
