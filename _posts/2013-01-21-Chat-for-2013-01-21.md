**2013-01-21 01:16:55 +0000** - **Test:** heya  
**2013-01-21 02:33:33 +0000** - **Raven7:** heya Test u made it !  
**2013-01-21 02:34:21 +0000** - **Raven7:** sorry i .. couldnt resist  
**2013-01-21 02:41:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** WTF? Dan and Haddie believed Lance Armstrong? That would surely require a lot of drugs.  
**2013-01-21 02:42:40 +0000** - **crucialwax:** dan did too? i thought it was just haddie.  
**2013-01-21 02:43:27 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I haven&apos;t listened to the episode yet, so I dunno... but it is titled &ast;we&ast; believed him  
**2013-01-21 02:43:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** although Dan almost certainly is on drugs with that Paleo nonsense  
**2013-01-21 02:43:58 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i heard some of that convo, but didn&apos;t catch it all  
**2013-01-21 02:44:47 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i accept paleo to a degree. mainly because my wife had a gut ailment that is directly caused by gluten surrounded carb, as found in wheat.  
**2013-01-21 02:45:02 +0000** - **crucialwax:** as does her twin  
**2013-01-21 02:46:03 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, you can accept anything to a degree... I was once a committed Vegan, but now know that it was mostly BS  
**2013-01-21 02:47:28 +0000** - **dsheehy:** there were good things about that diet, but the philosophical underpinnings were very shaky  
**2013-01-21 02:47:44 +0000** - **dsheehy:** ... as are most philosophical things  
**2013-01-21 02:48:10 +0000** - **crucialwax:** at face value, i&apos;ll accept the premise that food types we never ate through millions of years of evolution and only recently started eating could have some undesired effects. but it&apos;s ultimately a case by case thing for both old and new foods.  
**2013-01-21 02:49:04 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i ultimately think we just eat way too much.  
**2013-01-21 02:49:17 +0000** - **dsheehy:** well, yeah, what weirds me out is how Dan has such a hard-on for coffee, which I don&apos;t undrstand how it could ever be Paleo  
**2013-01-21 02:49:33 +0000** - **crucialwax:** it ain&apos;t. rationalization are just a river in ohio.  
**2013-01-21 02:49:38 +0000** - **crucialwax:** are = ain&apos;t  
**2013-01-21 02:49:50 +0000** - **Raven7:** i havent listened to the lance thing part2 .. is this in reference to part 2?  
**2013-01-21 02:50:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I like this newly invented grammar, crucialwax  
**2013-01-21 02:50:21 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i&apos;ll go with it then  
**2013-01-21 02:50:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Raven7: nope, just my knee-jerk based on the title  
**2013-01-21 02:51:11 +0000** - **Raven7:** ooh then u got it wrong... that was  
**2013-01-21 02:51:19 +0000** - **dsheehy:** am downloadin part one now, will listen soon  
**2013-01-21 02:51:19 +0000** - **Raven7:** for we believed him BEFORE  
**2013-01-21 02:51:34 +0000** - **Raven7:** not to we believe him NOW  
**2013-01-21 02:51:46 +0000** - **crucialwax:** yeah, but both dan and haddie?  
**2013-01-21 02:51:47 +0000** - **Raven7:** ie before the lie came out  
**2013-01-21 02:51:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, I still don&apos;t get it... why would you ever have believed him?  
**2013-01-21 02:52:04 +0000** - **dsheehy:** because, USA?  
**2013-01-21 02:52:28 +0000** - **Raven7:** yes.. before any news came out... because they well said.. they "wanted" to believe it.. if u get my drift  
**2013-01-21 02:52:42 +0000** - **crucialwax:** anyone who win 7 of anything i assume is doping  
**2013-01-21 02:53:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, OK, but shouldn&apos;t we all have known for a few decades that sports celebrities are bogus?  
**2013-01-21 02:53:10 +0000** - **Raven7:** youll get it when u listen... haddie explains what that means well  
**2013-01-21 02:53:16 +0000** - **Raven7:** in part 1 even  
**2013-01-21 02:53:31 +0000** - **crucialwax:** my mother brought home a little too much money from the crib tournament, and i forced her to submit to tests. we&apos;re ok again now. she understood.  
**2013-01-21 02:54:28 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I mean, these are people with very limited skills, who are practically worshipped... I don;t get why anybody would hold stock in what they say  
**2013-01-21 02:54:34 +0000** - **Raven7:** as for paleo... its just a going back to that "era" of foods... that seem more likely ok for man  
**2013-01-21 02:55:08 +0000** - **crucialwax:** someone said to me the other day "What&apos;s with the attention? Doesn&apos;t he just ride a bike?"  
**2013-01-21 02:56:05 +0000** - **dsheehy:** these two topics are remarkably related... if you adore some guy who rides a bike, I can see why you might think that an "era of foods" is also something to be admired  
**2013-01-21 02:56:39 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s an over-simplification of things  
**2013-01-21 02:56:41 +0000** - **Raven7:** i didnt even know Dan was a big coffee guy ... i must have forgot  
**2013-01-21 02:56:54 +0000** - **Raven7:** i thought it was merlin  
**2013-01-21 02:57:30 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Dan talks to Haddie about making sure he has coffee almost every day  
**2013-01-21 02:58:03 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I guess it could be an act to appease sponsors like Tonx, but I don&apos;t think so  
**2013-01-21 02:58:08 +0000** - **Raven7:** i belive u .. i for some reason never noticed  
**2013-01-21 02:59:19 +0000** - **Raven7:** merlin is so easy to picture as a coffee adict lol  
**2013-01-21 02:59:55 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I guess I should go and listen to this episode... sorry to be so mean to Dan, I just think something is off with his preachinessabout diet.... but each to their own  
**2013-01-21 03:00:29 +0000** - **Raven7:** does he really preach it? i seem to think he avoids the topic ... hates talking about it  
**2013-01-21 03:01:02 +0000** - **dsheehy:** well, it seems to have changed recently.... for example, he no longer hosts the Paleo Show  
**2013-01-21 03:01:29 +0000** - **Raven7:** so less paleo then ??  
**2013-01-21 03:01:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but it used to be a big deal - he had a whole show about it, and woukd chastis people for saying non-Paleo things  
**2013-01-21 03:01:48 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;chastise  
**2013-01-21 03:02:00 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;would  
**2013-01-21 03:02:03 +0000** - **Raven7:** oh .. hey do u know why that show dropped by chance ?  
**2013-01-21 03:02:08 +0000** - **dsheehy:** James Wood  
**2013-01-21 03:02:29 +0000** - **dsheehy:** nope  
**2013-01-21 03:02:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** not sure if it was the host who gave up on it, or Dan  
**2013-01-21 03:03:09 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it ws a pretty weird show  
**2013-01-21 03:03:15 +0000** - **Raven7:** ur right i see it is gone  
**2013-01-21 03:03:25 +0000** - **dsheehy:** probably just didn&apos;t fit 5by5  
**2013-01-21 03:03:28 +0000** - **Raven7:** oh wait no its there  
**2013-01-21 03:03:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it was almost like some kind of Oliver Stone conspiracy theory show  
**2013-01-21 03:03:55 +0000** - **Raven7:** ooh but no new for over a month  
**2013-01-21 03:04:01 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** Angelo&apos;s just been too busy, those shows take TONS of work  
**2013-01-21 03:04:31 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** and that We Believed Him thing is a reaction to the first half of the special, they&apos;re doing a followup for Part 2 tomorrow  
**2013-01-21 03:04:39 +0000** - **Raven7:** well im Paleo and cant listen to it... but that is because... long story short... he focus alwasy alwasy on the negative....  
**2013-01-21 03:04:46 +0000** - **Raven7:** and i live life seeing the positive  
**2013-01-21 03:05:05 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i only use the + end of batteries.  
**2013-01-21 03:05:17 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** I only use Positronic Brains  
**2013-01-21 03:05:24 +0000** - **dsheehy:** moiseschiu: really? doesn&apos;t seem like that much work to say crazy things.... I guess finding the bizarre audio clips takes some effort  
**2013-01-21 03:05:29 +0000** - **Raven7:** haha thats good  
**2013-01-21 03:06:00 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: I didn&apos;t listen to it regularly, so I&apos;m not in a great place to offer critique  
**2013-01-21 03:06:17 +0000** - **dsheehy:** THE WORLD WANTS TO DESTROY YOUR CHILDREN WITH CARBOHYDRATES  
**2013-01-21 03:06:28 +0000** - **Raven7:** i would love to listen to it.. but it always made me feel bad ... and im already Paleo lol  
**2013-01-21 03:06:38 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** if any of you guys are webcomics nerds, I&apos;ve got the creator of Bobbins, Scary Go Round, and Bad Machinery (and friend of R Stevens) John Allison for Giant Size in the morning slot previously known as "The B&A Slot"  
**2013-01-21 03:06:52 +0000** - **Raven7:** if i dont feel good or better after doing something .. i stop doing it  
**2013-01-21 03:06:54 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: to some extent, I can dig on that  
**2013-01-21 03:07:44 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** the insane amount of corporate marketing money as well as bought, part and parcel lobbying money that goes toward making absolutely UN-healthy food what the populace buys in mass quantities is ridiculous  
**2013-01-21 03:07:53 +0000** - **dsheehy:** moiseschiu: yeah, sorry to diss on it, as I said before, we have all had weird dietary/political hang-ups in our past. although maybe you haven&apos;t  
**2013-01-21 03:08:24 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: I have, and I can get how the Paleo show is the closest to a political show that 5by5 has ever had  
**2013-01-21 03:08:43 +0000** - **Raven7:** its just food to moi : )  
**2013-01-21 03:08:45 +0000** - **crucialwax:** actually, that is something i noticed with too much bread stuff. i have more back pain. and it seems i retain water or something, which i think might be the reason. since eating the way my wife has to eat for a medical issue, i ultimately feel better.  
**2013-01-21 03:09:13 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I&apos;m a bit of an outsider, bring un-American, but why not just teach kids not to buy into marketing?  
**2013-01-21 03:09:16 +0000** - **crucialwax:** when i eat lots of &apos;bread&apos;, my ring is tight. when i don&apos;t, it&apos;s looser.  
**2013-01-21 03:09:23 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** crucialwax: since dropping gluten-rich foods, it&apos;s easier for me to get my head around exercising, let alone actually doing it  
**2013-01-21 03:09:48 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: it&apos;s so endemic to American culture, it&apos;s disgusting.  
**2013-01-21 03:10:06 +0000** - **Raven7:** oh yes tons more energy droping or even just reducing glutten  
**2013-01-21 03:10:10 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** unfortunately, Idiocracy is much more realistic than fictive  
**2013-01-21 03:10:28 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, I hear they have things like McDonalds stores in High Schools  
**2013-01-21 03:10:34 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** Raven7: and improving sources of protein, better hydration, dropping sodas  
**2013-01-21 03:10:56 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: when I was in school, that was taboo, but all us kids loved the idea of it  
**2013-01-21 03:10:57 +0000** - **dsheehy:** hell, we even have McDonalds here in Childrens&apos; hospitals  
**2013-01-21 03:11:29 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** now there are MASSIVE food service vendors like Aramark whose business is built on systematically introducing that kind of non-food into schools nationwide  
**2013-01-21 03:11:41 +0000** - **Raven7:** really ... mcd inside a high school ? that is ... sad  
**2013-01-21 03:11:54 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** Pizza Hut, etc etc  
**2013-01-21 03:12:50 +0000** - **Raven7:** see they dont know yet...  
**2013-01-21 03:12:54 +0000** - **Raven7:** obviously  
**2013-01-21 03:13:00 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I just think the US political situation is too fucked up to even have such a conversation - Michelle Obama was lambasted by the Right for trying to encourage organic gardens and healthy food  
**2013-01-21 03:13:02 +0000** - **Raven7:** takes more time i guess  
**2013-01-21 03:13:25 +0000** - **Raven7:** thats just crazy dsheehy  
**2013-01-21 03:14:11 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Raven7: yeah, she planted an organic garden outside the Whit House, and was torn a new one for it  
**2013-01-21 03:14:45 +0000** - **crucialwax:** we just call those gardens here  
**2013-01-21 03:15:01 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it just keeps getting worse, as somehing as simple as gun safety will set back debate for another 5 years  
**2013-01-21 03:15:03 +0000** - **Raven7:** like what is the logic for how that is wrong  
**2013-01-21 03:15:10 +0000** - **Raven7:** how is a garden wrong  
**2013-01-21 03:15:34 +0000** - **dsheehy:** well, a garden takes away profits from the military-industrial complex  
**2013-01-21 03:16:16 +0000** - **Raven7:** well that doesnt even need a response - a child can see through that  
**2013-01-21 03:16:39 +0000** - **dsheehy:** also, you can enjoy ourself in a garden, without paying for 3D glasses  
**2013-01-21 03:20:23 +0000** - **Raven7:** heck schools should garden more... very very educational imo  
**2013-01-21 03:20:54 +0000** - **Raven7:** although timing is a bit off because of summer  
**2013-01-21 03:21:06 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Well, yah, that&apos;s what people should be doing  
**2013-01-21 03:21:09 +0000** - **TorpedoSkyline:** schools should garden more  
**2013-01-21 03:21:14 +0000** - **TorpedoSkyline:** that would be awesome  
**2013-01-21 03:21:36 +0000** - **dsheehy:** the education they give kids is so distorted  
**2013-01-21 03:21:55 +0000** - **tjbarber:** lol yep  
**2013-01-21 03:22:19 +0000** - **dsheehy:** the majority would be better off doing things like nursing or gardening, but the schools act as if everybody is going to become a doctor orscientist  
**2013-01-21 03:22:40 +0000** - **Raven7:** i have learned so much about life and the world by gardening  
**2013-01-21 03:23:35 +0000** - **dsheehy:** nothing against science of course, it&apos;s the best thing ever.... but only a few have that proficiency  
**2013-01-21 03:24:46 +0000** - **dsheehy:** ... and the majority of those are best suited for the applied sciences or engineering, not pur science  
**2013-01-21 03:24:51 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;pure  
**2013-01-21 03:24:57 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;or typing  
**2013-01-21 03:25:18 +0000** - **Raven7:** i thought i had read somewhere... that there was a trend for hospitals of all places... to be gardening more...  
**2013-01-21 03:26:34 +0000** - **tjbarber:** gardening is awesome&hellip; I&apos;m glad Michelle Obama has one.  
**2013-01-21 03:26:57 +0000** - **dsheehy:** that could make some snese... the problem is the supply chain - gardening and cooking is very labour intensive... the problem is not the lack of good food, but getting it to people  
**2013-01-21 03:27:11 +0000** - **tjbarber:** what I wish wasn&apos;t the case is that she spends thousands on luxurious trips when this country is in bad economic shape  
**2013-01-21 03:27:54 +0000** - **tjbarber:** true dsheehy  
**2013-01-21 03:28:13 +0000** - **dsheehy:** tjbarber: the amount the Presidential couple spends on trps is insignificant - even when they aren&apos;t travelling, their security detail costs more than any trips  
**2013-01-21 03:28:21 +0000** - **tjbarber:** what&apos;s so good about good food is that there&apos;s no preservatives  
**2013-01-21 03:28:36 +0000** - **Raven7:** and it tastes better to boot  
**2013-01-21 03:28:40 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy oh yeah, granted. but it&apos;s all coming from the taxpayers in the end.  
**2013-01-21 03:28:49 +0000** - **Raven7:** and then u feel better.. its like a cycle  
**2013-01-21 03:29:19 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW.... why do I keep making myself angry?  
**2013-01-21 03:29:34 +0000** - **tjbarber:** Raven7, the thing is that it can&apos;t be transported in a timely manner, so getting it to people is pretty difficult.  
**2013-01-21 03:29:44 +0000** - **tjbarber:** but to me that&apos;s one of the beauties of it ;P  
**2013-01-21 03:29:58 +0000** - **tjbarber:** local food is the best  
**2013-01-21 03:30:10 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy, u mad? =P  
**2013-01-21 03:30:12 +0000** - **Raven7:** dsheehy  ... its a choice... really is  
**2013-01-21 03:30:19 +0000** - **Raven7:** u can choose the other :)  
**2013-01-21 03:30:38 +0000** - **Raven7:** anytime u want  
**2013-01-21 03:30:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, but it would seem ridiculous not to be angry right now  
**2013-01-21 03:31:05 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I don&apos;t understand how people can be so laid back, with all the shit going on  
**2013-01-21 03:31:22 +0000** - **dsheehy:** y&apos;know, whatever, man  
**2013-01-21 03:31:29 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy angry about the education of kids, the diet of Americans, or?  
**2013-01-21 03:31:36 +0000** - **tjbarber:** for me it&apos;s all of the above  
**2013-01-21 03:31:42 +0000** - **tjbarber:** !merlin  
**2013-01-21 03:31:42 +0000** - **showbot:** ...Cleric...  
**2013-01-21 03:31:43 +0000** - **Raven7:** but thats like saying.... i cannot prosper until i am unhappy  
**2013-01-21 03:32:03 +0000** - **dsheehy:** up  
**2013-01-21 03:32:15 +0000** - **tjbarber:** meh  
**2013-01-21 03:32:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s as bad for me as junk food and alcohol  
**2013-01-21 03:33:04 +0000** - **tjbarber:** We need to have a QUIT episode all about taxes  
**2013-01-21 03:33:24 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but it&apos;s so universal... not just America, as soon as any place gets developed and rich enough, people get lazy and self-destructive  
**2013-01-21 03:33:25 +0000** - **Raven7:** i can think of a ton of things for Quit! :)  
**2013-01-21 03:33:40 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy right on.  
**2013-01-21 03:33:58 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Australia today is probably ground-zero for this stuff, people buying bigger cars and shit  
**2013-01-21 03:34:20 +0000** - **dsheehy:** America&apos;s decline might actually help improve things  
**2013-01-21 03:34:24 +0000** - **Raven7:** but wait... you can only really change u ... start with yourself  
**2013-01-21 03:34:29 +0000** - **Raven7:** you are not them  
**2013-01-21 03:34:41 +0000** - **Raven7:** you are in a diverse world  
**2013-01-21 03:34:52 +0000** - **Raven7:** there is strength in diversity  
**2013-01-21 03:35:00 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy, I think a decline for America would be the beginning of a new upswing  
**2013-01-21 03:35:38 +0000** - **tjbarber:** we have to get off our rears and be willing to make the country a better place. that doesn&apos;t come from sitting around watching Kim Kardashian.  
**2013-01-21 03:35:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, the post-WWII era for America was a pretty crazy anomaly  
**2013-01-21 03:36:30 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s hard to believe that Australia now has a higher dollar than the US - when I was growing up, our dollar was worth about 50 cents US  
**2013-01-21 03:36:47 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and unemployment was staggering  
**2013-01-21 03:36:56 +0000** - **tjbarber:** which do you think caused more damage to human kind and our thought process? TV or Facebook?  
**2013-01-21 03:37:01 +0000** - **Raven7:** because of china growth... they use your countries resources  
**2013-01-21 03:37:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yep... we&apos;re just selling off pollution to overseas investors  
**2013-01-21 03:37:55 +0000** - **dsheehy:** massive holes in the ground  
**2013-01-21 03:38:30 +0000** - **Raven7:** usually made into lakes later  
**2013-01-21 03:38:36 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but it&apos;s politically an easy choice - we&apos;re getting better margins on our minerals than China is in manufacturing products from them  
**2013-01-21 03:39:18 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but then we just buy them back, anyway  
**2013-01-21 03:39:58 +0000** - **dsheehy:** tjbarber: Khloe Kardashian is the best one  
**2013-01-21 03:40:29 +0000** - **Raven7:** tjbarber thats easy TV  
**2013-01-21 03:42:30 +0000** - **tjbarber:** yep  
**2013-01-21 03:42:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** tjbarber: As for TV, I kind of think that Facebook is worse - even with TV monpolies, there are tons of competing companies, while Facebook wants to won the entire world of online communication  
**2013-01-21 03:42:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;own  
**2013-01-21 03:43:49 +0000** - **tjbarber:** dsheehy, true I think Facebook is worse in a business regard. But I think TV has done more to damage our attention span  
**2013-01-21 03:44:02 +0000** - **Raven7:** and brain  
**2013-01-21 03:44:11 +0000** - **tjbarber:** oh man, I hear a coyote  
**2013-01-21 03:44:11 +0000** - **dsheehy:** the weird part is how even people who think TV companies are evil, have no hesitation signing up for Facebook  
**2013-01-21 03:45:06 +0000** - **dsheehy:** at least we have the Simpsons  
**2013-01-21 03:45:11 +0000** - **tjbarber:** LOL  
**2013-01-21 03:45:18 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and Arrested Development  
**2013-01-21 03:45:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and Twin Peaks  
**2013-01-21 03:45:45 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I don&apos;t think Facebook has created aything remotely of that kind of value  
**2013-01-21 03:46:20 +0000** - **Raven7:** and PBS  
**2013-01-21 03:46:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and the ABC and SBS (Australia)  
**2013-01-21 03:46:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and Breaking Bad  
**2013-01-21 03:47:05 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and Grls  
**2013-01-21 03:47:25 +0000** - **Raven7:** oh PBS is our Public Broadcasting .. its the "thinking" tv  
**2013-01-21 03:47:25 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;Girls (to do the dishes)  
**2013-01-21 03:47:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Oh, I know PBS, I&apos;m a regular viewer  
**2013-01-21 03:48:09 +0000** - **dsheehy:** ABC and SBS are our (formerly) non-commercial networks  
**2013-01-21 03:48:32 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** if only PBS here in the States would air goddamn Downton Abbey at the same goddamn time as ITV in the UK  
**2013-01-21 03:48:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** with a great rack-record in investigative journalism, multicultural affairs, etc  
**2013-01-21 03:48:52 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;track  
**2013-01-21 03:49:16 +0000** - **dsheehy:** although SBS did have a great rack-record in airing foreign art-house films with boobies  
**2013-01-21 03:49:23 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** oh, and in case my fellow SO ANGRY jackals hadn&apos;t seen, new (and shorter than usual) Giant Size and Screen Time are now in the feed  
**2013-01-21 03:49:39 +0000** - **dsheehy:** essentially, our ABC is like Britain&apos;s BBC  
**2013-01-21 03:50:05 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** dsheehy: if you talk about a thing called ABC that way, you&apos;re an Aussie  
**2013-01-21 03:50:06 +0000** - **dsheehy:** SBS is kind of unique, I don;t think anything like it exitedbefore  
**2013-01-21 03:53:20 +0000** - **Raven7:** man i need to do a podcast on anger i see - lol  
**2013-01-21 03:53:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** AngryCast  
**2013-01-21 03:57:18 +0000** - **Raven7:**  i have to get a little work done... i will read more text later  
**2013-01-21 03:57:50 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it would just be 90 minutes of guys screaming  
**2013-01-21 13:29:23 +0000** - **JoshAronoff:** sup jackals  
**2013-01-21 13:30:15 +0000** - **prehnRA:** morning  
**2013-01-21 13:34:24 +0000** - **co1e:** morning  
**2013-01-21 14:43:27 +0000** - **jamuraa:** morning  
**2013-01-21 14:44:14 +0000** - **theTiger:** Morning.  
**2013-01-21 14:44:58 +0000** - **prehnRA:** morning  
**2013-01-21 14:45:08 +0000** - **edwardloveall:** morning  
**2013-01-21 14:45:11 +0000** - **marvi:** Good afternoon  
**2013-01-21 14:45:20 +0000** - **edwardloveall:** damn it marvi  
**2013-01-21 14:45:46 +0000** - **theTiger:** C-C-C-Combo Breaker!  
**2013-01-21 14:46:15 +0000** - **haroldina:** Doctor  
**2013-01-21 14:47:34 +0000** - **prehnRA:** in the one true time zone it is morning  
**2013-01-21 14:47:57 +0000** - **theTiger:** You can&apos;t spell best without EST. :)  
**2013-01-21 14:48:29 +0000** - **theTiger:** (British summer time also applicable.)  
**2013-01-21 14:48:44 +0000** - *prehnRA lives in the central time zone, but LIVES BY eastern time.&ast;  *
**2013-01-21 14:49:12 +0000** - **marvi:** Universal (UCT) beats bEST.  
**2013-01-21 14:49:15 +0000** - **prehnRA:** or sometimes UTC if i&apos;m coding  
**2013-01-21 14:49:39 +0000** - **prehnRA:** but only when i&apos;m talking to my credit card processor, because they speak UTC  
**2013-01-21 14:49:40 +0000** - **theTiger:** Meh, there&apos;s always math involved with UTC.  
**2013-01-21 14:49:50 +0000** - **marvi:** The Sun Never Sets on the British Empire.  
**2013-01-21 14:50:17 +0000** - **theTiger:** For various values of &apos;never&apos; and &apos;British Empire&apos;.  
**2013-01-21 14:50:48 +0000** - **prehnRA:** just set your servers to UTC/GMT  
**2013-01-21 14:51:03 +0000** - **prehnRA:** math goes away  
**2013-01-21 14:51:16 +0000** - **edwardloveall:** America/New_York  
**2013-01-21 14:51:26 +0000** - **theTiger:** But then you have to talk with &apos;normal people&apos;.  
**2013-01-21 14:51:27 +0000** - **marvi:** There should be a variable $TIMEZONE_GREETING and the clients should translate it. IRC sucks.  
**2013-01-21 14:51:31 +0000** - **edwardloveall:** USA! USA! USA!  
**2013-01-21 14:51:38 +0000** - **theTiger:** Or worse&hellip; UNIX folk. &ast;shudders&ast;  
**2013-01-21 14:51:56 +0000** - **mindfad:** theTiger: Erm, so ... there are actually four “Cuhs” (C-C-C-C-Combo Breaker) in the Killer Instinct sound effect.  
**2013-01-21 14:52:01 +0000** - **prehnRA:** just tell everyone you are based in england  
**2013-01-21 14:52:02 +0000** - **mindfad:** !vanhoet  
**2013-01-21 14:52:02 +0000** - **showbot:** Erm, so.  
**2013-01-21 14:52:10 +0000** - **prehnRA:** thus explaining the weird times coming from your server  
**2013-01-21 14:52:26 +0000** - *theTiger is properly ashamed.&ast;  *
**2013-01-21 14:52:51 +0000** - **marvi:** Didn&apos;t Swatch try to introduce "Internet Time" in the 90&apos;s ?  
**2013-01-21 14:53:01 +0000** - **theTiger:** It&apos;s still around.  
**2013-01-21 14:53:13 +0000** - **theTiger:** [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CFkQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.swatch.com%2Fzz_en%2Finternettime%2F&ei=UVb9UK3NA5C49gTM8YCwBA&usg=AFQjCNGSyWpsLIFXO0_moB6W-0kvqn0Mdg&bvm=bv.41248874,d.eWU](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CFkQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.swatch.com%2Fzz_en%2Finternettime%2F&ei=UVb9UK3NA5C49gTM8YCwBA&usg=AFQjCNGSyWpsLIFXO0_moB6W-0kvqn0Mdg&bvm=bv.41248874,d.eWU)  
**2013-01-21 14:53:26 +0000** - **theTiger:** Holy lengthy URL, Batman!!  
**2013-01-21 14:53:29 +0000** - **theTiger:** Sorry about that. :(  
**2013-01-21 14:53:35 +0000** - **mindfad:** I blame Google.  
**2013-01-21 14:53:38 +0000** - **theTiger:** [http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/internettime/](http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/internettime/)  
**2013-01-21 14:54:04 +0000** - **prehnRA:** if i wore a watch with two dials, it would be UTC and ET. if it had three, it would be UTC, ET, and CT. but then my arm would be tired.  
**2013-01-21 14:55:11 +0000** - **theTiger:** "web supporter" and "cyber friend"&hellip; I love the copy on this page. :)  
**2013-01-21 14:57:49 +0000** - **prehnRA:** dealing with times when programming is one of those things that seems like it would be simple, but is actually terrible  
**2013-01-21 14:58:12 +0000** - **theTiger:** Aren&apos;t there libraries to help you out?  
**2013-01-21 14:58:25 +0000** - **prehnRA:** yes, definitely, still a mess  
**2013-01-21 14:58:39 +0000** - **prehnRA:** because you still have to pick your classes carefully  
**2013-01-21 14:58:54 +0000** - **prehnRA:** do i need a timezone aware time object here, or a naive one?  
**2013-01-21 14:59:04 +0000** - **theTiger:** I never really got to the practical part of my CS education&hellip; Though given the number of time standards, this isn&apos;t very surprising.  
**2013-01-21 14:59:06 +0000** - **prehnRA:** do i need to worry about leap seconds?  
**2013-01-21 15:00:02 +0000** - **prehnRA:** the "do not disturb" bug on iOS earlier this year was caused by a built in time/date library  
**2013-01-21 15:00:31 +0000** - **prehnRA:** because a coder at apple, using an apple library called the wrong choice  out of two possible current year functions  
**2013-01-21 15:00:55 +0000** - **marvi:** And now he&apos;s looking for work?  
**2013-01-21 15:01:12 +0000** - **prehnRA:** who knows  
**2013-01-21 15:01:23 +0000** - **prehnRA:** but that&apos;s why the bug fixed itself after seven days  
**2013-01-21 15:01:29 +0000** - **jamuraa:** love how there are two current year functions  
**2013-01-21 15:01:44 +0000** - **prehnRA:** because the values returned became the same (2013) after 1/7  
**2013-01-21 15:01:52 +0000** - **jamuraa:** it&apos;s probably business year vs. calendar year  
**2013-01-21 15:02:12 +0000** - **theTiger:** It&apos;s how the various time standards define the first week of the year.  
**2013-01-21 15:02:24 +0000** - **jamuraa:** AKA "Last Monday&apos;s year" vs. "Today&apos;s year"  
**2013-01-21 15:02:29 +0000** - **prehnRA:** jamuraa: sometime like that. or years w/o leap days vs. years w/ leap days.  
**2013-01-21 15:02:48 +0000** - **prehnRA:** jamuraa: yeah, actually i think that was it.  
**2013-01-21 15:03:17 +0000** - **jamuraa:** I don&apos;t see how DND needed to care about the year anyway, but whatever  
**2013-01-21 15:05:22 +0000** - **theTiger:** [http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/01/ask-ars-why-will-apples-do-not-disturb-bug-fix-itself-next-week/](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/01/ask-ars-why-will-apples-do-not-disturb-bug-fix-itself-next-week/)  
**2013-01-21 15:06:23 +0000** - **prehnRA:** on the surface DND doesn&apos;t need the year, but internally there is probably a much more complex interface to DND-- for future extension/app integration  
**2013-01-21 15:06:40 +0000** - **prehnRA:** like a potential "do not disturb" on holidays function  
**2013-01-21 15:06:45 +0000** - **theTiger:** (The featured comment agrees with you.)  
**2013-01-21 15:07:18 +0000** - **prehnRA:** oh nice, two votes for my idea  
**2013-01-21 15:07:51 +0000** - **haroldina:** I didn&apos;t hear the Coke ad in this episode before. It sounds like the Veridian Dynamics ads in Better Off Ted.  
**2013-01-21 15:08:42 +0000** - **prehnRA:** i once had to track down a really fun time related bug that turned out to be because the library in question was converting dates to string before comparing-- and one was converting to dd/mm/yyyy and the other to mm/dd/yyyy  
**2013-01-21 15:09:10 +0000** - **prehnRA:** because it was a networked app and some servers were using international date formats, and others using the USAian dates  
**2013-01-21 15:09:37 +0000** - **prehnRA:** it almost rendered me temporarily insane  
**2013-01-21 15:09:53 +0000** - **jamuraa:** all dates should be yyyy-mm-dd IMHO  
**2013-01-21 15:10:26 +0000** - **dsheehy:** howare calories not "nutritional value"?  
**2013-01-21 15:10:38 +0000** - **theTiger:** DANG IT!  
**2013-01-21 15:10:45 +0000** - **theTiger:** I completely forgot about the essay. :(  
**2013-01-21 15:10:48 +0000** - **dsheehy:** by definition, it is a unit of energy  
**2013-01-21 15:11:34 +0000** - **prehnRA:** i think dates should be yyyy-mm-dd personally too-- significant to least significant  
**2013-01-21 15:11:56 +0000** - **prehnRA:** if you always do that, you can still string sort dates and have it be OK  
**2013-01-21 15:12:04 +0000** - **jamuraa:** prehnra: as a bonus, dates sort lexically automatically  
**2013-01-21 15:12:13 +0000** - **prehnRA:** (assuming everyone it in the same timezone)  
**2013-01-21 15:12:25 +0000** - **prehnRA:** (assuming everyone is in the same timezone)  
**2013-01-21 15:12:35 +0000** - **prehnRA:** once again, naive vs. aware time objects  
**2013-01-21 15:13:13 +0000** - **theTiger:** naïve. :)  
**2013-01-21 15:15:13 +0000** - **prehnRA:** yes, too lazy to hit the appropriate option key combo  
**2013-01-21 15:15:42 +0000** - **theTiger:** If you&apos;re on Lion or later, just hold the key down and select from the list.  
**2013-01-21 15:15:59 +0000** - **prehnRA:** whoa.  
**2013-01-21 15:16:04 +0000** - **marvi:** Cool, didn&apos;t know that.  
**2013-01-21 15:16:27 +0000** - *theTiger hums "The More You Know".&ast;  *
**2013-01-21 15:16:28 +0000** - **prehnRA:** now i can spell mois&eacute;s&apos; name properly. i think.  
**2013-01-21 15:16:52 +0000** - **prehnRA:** punctuation, however, i still can not do properly  
**2013-01-21 15:17:23 +0000** - **theTiger:** Or capitalization. But, don&apos;t worry. I barely even notice. This is the Internet after all. :)  
**2013-01-21 15:17:54 +0000** - **prehnRA:** yeah, that&apos;s never going to change  
**2013-01-21 15:18:21 +0000** - *theTiger weeps quietly for the English language.&ast;  *
**2013-01-21 15:20:40 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Inianda Jones Nazis are the best  
**2013-01-21 15:20:52 +0000** - **dsheehy:** way better than Illinois Nazis  
**2013-01-21 15:22:27 +0000** - **prehnRA:** adding all of those extra cycles to your shift key. tsk tsk.  
**2013-01-21 15:22:55 +0000** - **theTiger:** I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve lost a shift key yet. :)  
**2013-01-21 15:23:37 +0000** - **tass:** any idea when frequency starts?  
**2013-01-21 15:24:52 +0000** - **theTiger:** If you have to ask . . . :)  
**2013-01-21 15:26:07 +0000** - **haroldina:** Must be new here.  
**2013-01-21 15:26:09 +0000** - **haroldina:** :)  
**2013-01-21 15:32:53 +0000** - **theTiger:** I think my next frames are coming from there. :)  
**2013-01-21 15:37:54 +0000** - **Murdo:** is the show live?  
**2013-01-21 15:38:02 +0000** - **theTiger:** No.  
**2013-01-21 15:38:21 +0000** - **theTiger:** I believe this is Friday&apos;s show on the feed.  
**2013-01-21 15:38:27 +0000** - **theTiger:** Thursday or Friday.  
**2013-01-21 15:38:31 +0000** - **jamuraa:** no, it&apos;s like, wednesday  
**2013-01-21 15:38:45 +0000** - **theTiger:** They all run together after a while. :)  
**2013-01-21 15:38:53 +0000** - **jamuraa:**  - /latest is 65, which would have been Friday  
**2013-01-21 15:39:01 +0000** - **Murdo:** haha,  
**2013-01-21 15:39:07 +0000** - **jamuraa:** and they&apos;re talking about /63

**2013-01-21 16:39:15 +0000** - **Particulate:** apparently, people who don&apos;t recall 9/11 are a different gen.  
**2013-01-21 16:39:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Qualcomm already answered that: Generation M  
**2013-01-21 16:39:24 +0000** - **haroldina:** Everywhere I looked said Gen Y started in 1980  
**2013-01-21 16:39:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** membership of Generation M requires you to be a highly annoying stereotype

**2013-01-21 16:49:36 +0000** - **Murdo:** some runners dope just to finish a marathon.

**2013-01-21 16:50:48 +0000** - **Murdo:** That would be sooo cold.  
**2013-01-21 16:50:55 +0000** - **dsheehy:** this is creeping me out  
**2013-01-21 16:51:21 +0000** - **crucialwax:** they can do it. they put just red blood cells back in though. not the entire blood mix.  
**2013-01-21 16:51:31 +0000** - **haroldina:** dsheehy: Is that even possible?  
**2013-01-21 16:51:36 +0000** - **crumpf:** danbenjamin: they concentrate the red blood cells and put them back in.  
**2013-01-21 16:51:44 +0000** - **theTiger:** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping)  
**2013-01-21 16:51:59 +0000** - **badhedgehog:** My mate Dr Vanessa The Historian on doping in Victorian times: [http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style)  
**2013-01-21 16:52:00 +0000** - **theTiger:** And this will be Special 12  
**2013-01-21 16:52:21 +0000** - **crumpf:** danbenjamin: the additional red blood cells transfer more oxygen thereby giving an artificial advantage  
**2013-01-21 16:56:59 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** what did he mean when he said "Isn&apos;t that scary?" after he said he didn&apos;t feel like he was cheating? He said it like three times.  
**2013-01-21 17:00:48 +0000** - **Murdo:** someone stole my bike. :(  
**2013-01-21 17:04:37 +0000** - **theTiger:** Because we don&apos;t have any firm Science on what doping does to people in the long-term.  
**2013-01-21 17:04:49 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Here is a list of banned substances: [http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=002037](http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=002037)

**2013-01-21 17:06:30 +0000** - **cefranco2:** I rode the "big loop" in Austin and in the group was a 12yr old girl. She was beating the older men and women like nothing. 12.  
**2013-01-21 17:06:38 +0000** - **cefranco2:** amazing to see.  
**2013-01-21 17:07:42 +0000** - **cefranco2:** TT/Climber combo&apos;s mostly win  
**2013-01-21 17:08:26 +0000** - **cefranco2:** 2yrs was the norm  
**2013-01-21 17:09:34 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Hincappie was the turning point for me  
**2013-01-21 17:10:07 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Hamilton was sneaky already  
**2013-01-21 17:10:41 +0000** - **cefranco2:** he&apos;ll get a lifetime ban  
**2013-01-21 17:11:00 +0000** - **cefranco2:** the UCI, WADA and the ownders of hte  Tour wont want him riding again  
**2013-01-21 17:11:09 +0000** - **cefranco2:** owners&ast;  
**2013-01-21 17:13:46 +0000** - **cefranco2:** jan ulrich should have won more Tours  
**2013-01-21 17:13:52 +0000** - **cefranco2:** sad.  
**2013-01-21 17:13:52 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** Was Hincappie doping too? I&apos;m sure he was. Hs he suffered any penalties?  
**2013-01-21 17:13:56 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Yep.  
**2013-01-21 17:14:03 +0000** - **cefranco2:** he said he did with US Postal  
**2013-01-21 17:14:21 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** yeah, i&apos;m sure the whole team was  
**2013-01-21 17:14:26 +0000** - **cefranco2:** i&apos;m not sure about penalties yet. I haven&apos;t heard.  
**2013-01-21 17:14:45 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** well, hicappie retired last year right?  
**2013-01-21 17:14:57 +0000** - **cefranco2:** He came out last year..  
**2013-01-21 17:15:01 +0000** - **cefranco2:** so it&apos;s possible.

**2013-01-21 17:16:03 +0000** - **uv_:** Congrats, you have a new prez.  
**2013-01-21 17:16:33 +0000** - **theTiger:** He took the oath yesterday. :)  
**2013-01-21 17:16:43 +0000** - **theTiger:** This one was just for show.  
**2013-01-21 17:17:57 +0000** - **uv_:** Well, he didn&apos;t declare war on the Republicans yesterday. ;)  
**2013-01-21 17:18:22 +0000** - **theTiger:** I&apos;ll have to read the speech later.  
**2013-01-21 17:18:36 +0000** - **crucialwax:** people are a mix of good and bad choices most of the time. but it still fair to let it raise questions about his ethics and to examine his actions in the charity.  
**2013-01-21 17:19:58 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** i don&apos;t think he feels guilty, because he still feels justified in what he did... because doping was a best practice in those days... still kind of is.... but it&apos;s too hard to explain that to the general public so he knows, intellectually that he needs to appear remorseful  
**2013-01-21 17:21:45 +0000** - **crucialwax:** in the case of woods, i don&apos;t actually think that was anyone&apos;s business but his and his wife&apos;s.  
**2013-01-21 17:22:07 +0000** - **theTiger:** He played poorly.  
**2013-01-21 17:22:48 +0000** - **crucialwax:** if his sponsor contracts have a clause that cover his moral behaviour, then it&apos;s their business i guess. but it was never mine.  
**2013-01-21 17:24:01 +0000** - **metafour:** but having the attitude that I can do it because others are doing it is juvenile  
**2013-01-21 17:24:53 +0000** - **crucialwax:** that should be up to each governing body to choose to allow him or not  
**2013-01-21 17:26:30 +0000** - **cefranco2:** 14yrs for a cyclist is a lifetime ban  
**2013-01-21 17:26:50 +0000** - **haroldina:** Come back after 14 years by doping a lot harder.  
**2013-01-21 17:28:58 +0000** - **theTiger:** I think that it was probably just irrational.  
**2013-01-21 17:29:15 +0000** - **cefranco2:** screw Lance.. What does it do to his children?  
**2013-01-21 17:29:23 +0000** - **cefranco2:** what legacy will it leave them?  
**2013-01-21 17:29:50 +0000** - **theTiger:** He doesn&apos;t seem like a very nice guy. I wouldn&apos;t want to go out for beers with him.  
**2013-01-21 17:30:02 +0000** - **metafour:** He has no integrity, no honor.  
**2013-01-21 17:30:20 +0000** - **cefranco2:** a few friends of mine have had run in&apos;s with him before, they said in the two seconds they met him, he was an ass.  
**2013-01-21 17:30:31 +0000** - **wafflejuice:** lets&apos;s not gloss over the people he tried to ruin in the coverup  
**2013-01-21 17:31:08 +0000** - **theTiger:** He&apos;s not internalizing yet.  
**2013-01-21 17:31:28 +0000** - **metafour:** Yeah, he _ruined_ people to cover up his own behavior  
**2013-01-21 17:31:37 +0000** - **dsheehy:** he&apos;s an automoton, perhaps?  
**2013-01-21 17:31:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** he needs to borrow Siracusa&apos;s emotion chip  
**2013-01-21 17:32:13 +0000** - **metafour:** I think it&apos;s just more selfishness than anything else  
**2013-01-21 17:32:33 +0000** - **crucialwax:** he has to live by a higher standard now in order to be seen on the up and up.  
**2013-01-21 17:32:40 +0000** - **cefranco2:** danbenjamin: [http://www.outsideonline.com/templates/Outside_Print_Template?content=167790055](http://www.outsideonline.com/templates/Outside_Print_Template?content=167790055)  this guy moved to New Zealand from Austin  
**2013-01-21 17:33:18 +0000** - **cefranco2:** after Lance screwed him over.  
**2013-01-21 17:34:02 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Most even organizers wont want him racing in their races.  
**2013-01-21 17:34:12 +0000** - **dsheehy:** is this not the inevitable end point of competitive sports?  
**2013-01-21 17:34:12 +0000** - **crucialwax:** each governing body should be free to decide if he&apos;s allowed in.  
**2013-01-21 17:34:16 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Even if he "can"race, doesnt mean he&apos;ll be "invited"  
**2013-01-21 17:34:28 +0000** - **cefranco2:** Event organizers can deny any rider they want  
**2013-01-21 17:35:20 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I feel having competitions with too high stakes just sucks all the joy out of sports  
**2013-01-21 17:35:35 +0000** - **kevinwoodland:** he needs to just start his own race. he&apos;ll probably be the only person to show up.  
**2013-01-21 17:35:36 +0000** - **metafour:** I say no to that too. He will still be in the spotlight which is part of what he wants.  
**2013-01-21 17:36:32 +0000** - **metafour:** Stop giving him any attention at all. Let the sanctions and lawsuits come and let his legacy sunset.  
**2013-01-21 17:36:46 +0000** - **theTiger:** It&apos;s his livelihood.  
**2013-01-21 17:37:26 +0000** - **theTiger:** He was the answer to a trivia question last night. Heh.  
**2013-01-21 17:38:05 +0000** - **cefranco2:** i feel sorry for the female pro: kristin armstrong. she&apos;s a huge winner for female cycling. I hope people dont associate her with him. They are not related.  
**2013-01-21 17:38:09 +0000** - **crucialwax:** are they still making airplane movies? he can work in those now.  
**2013-01-21 17:38:36 +0000** - **metafour:** The guy at Radio Shack last night didn&apos;t even ask about the Livestrong donation that shows up on their credit card machine as you&apos;re checking out  
**2013-01-21 17:38:37 +0000** - **theTiger:** I think Hank Aaron is in the same boat as Lemonde.  
**2013-01-21 17:38:58 +0000** - **metafour:** Said it&apos;s a pretty hard sell right now  
**2013-01-21 17:39:21 +0000** - **theTiger:** EPO?  
**2013-01-21 17:39:22 +0000** - **wafflejuice:** I&apos;m glad they&apos;re talking about this.  
**2013-01-21 17:40:59 +0000** - **crucialwax:** carl lewis seemed to be ok with it
