**2013-10-10T00:14:03+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The Prompt 17 with @viticci, @imyke, and @ismh - http://t.co/QMKgwX9eKQ (45 seconds ago)  
**2013-10-10T16:00:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger  
**2013-10-10T16:01:06+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yes, sir?  
**2013-10-10T16:01:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Just cut myself again  
**2013-10-10T16:01:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** STOP DOING THAT!  
**2013-10-10T16:01:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** At least this one is just a bandage fix  
**2013-10-10T16:02:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Once again, I blame the contact cement  
**2013-10-10T16:02:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh. :)  
**2013-10-10T16:03:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's right by my wedding ring, though, and it's kind of hard to get the bandage to cover it completely  
**2013-10-10T16:04:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Time for the ring to come off.  
**2013-10-10T16:05:41+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I should let my wife know so she can pretend to freak out about how we're not married.  
**2013-10-10T16:07:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Huh. It appears I have a big wood sliver in my right middle finger, too. I wonder when that got there.  
**2013-10-10T16:08:24+00:00** - *theTiger shakes his head.*  
**2013-10-10T16:08:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You need to talk with your supervisor about your work environment. :D  
**2013-10-10T16:09:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm going to look awfully strange talking to myself.  
**2013-10-10T16:09:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Huh. I kind of expected Little Ryan to be blonde.  
**2013-10-10T16:10:07+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yeah, and a little more… little.  
**2013-10-10T16:10:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I figured he was probably average-sized.  
**2013-10-10T16:11:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Let's just say that my mental image of Little Ryan is now entirely ruined by the reality of Little Ryan.  
**2013-10-10T16:11:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Were you picturing Richie Rich?  
**2013-10-10T16:15:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** No, one take on one of my employees actually.  
**2013-10-10T16:15:36+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Short broad-shoulder young fellow with short cropped hair.  
**2013-10-10T16:15:55+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** No particularly reason as to why though.  
**2013-10-10T16:24:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You know, for kids.  
**2013-10-10T16:28:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Gah. I feel naked without this ring. I've now lost both pieces of jewelry I wear.  
**2013-10-10T16:28:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It feels so wrong.  
**2013-10-10T16:29:16+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh.  
**2013-10-10T16:29:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** It will be back in time.  
**2013-10-10T16:29:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah  
**2013-10-10T16:29:51+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** In time for what?  
**2013-10-10T16:29:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I still have to decide if I want to send my watch back for repairs.  
**2013-10-10T16:30:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** _HolyCow: A point in the future.  
**2013-10-10T16:31:12+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Also how did you get it out of time?  
**2013-10-10T16:31:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm special  
**2013-10-10T16:31:21+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Are you a wizard?  
**2013-10-10T16:31:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** He's a looper. I'm running him.  
**2013-10-10T16:31:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** As far as you ,know, yes.  
**2013-10-10T16:32:03+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The extra ,comma,s show I kn,ow how to use m,agic  
**2013-10-10T16:32:24+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I don't think it shows what you think it shows  
**2013-10-10T16:32:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** inconceivable!  
**2013-10-10T16:34:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** For some reason the phrase "she's got such nicely rounded diphthongs" just popped into my head.  
**2013-10-10T16:34:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think the wood shop next door must be spraying finishes today.  
**2013-10-10T16:34:57+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You're high and smell 'nice'?  
**2013-10-10T16:35:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Nice!™  
**2013-10-10T16:35:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's more of a contact cement high  
**2013-10-10T16:36:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Stay away from the Contact Cement.  
**2013-10-10T16:36:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm over half way done edging these tops  
**2013-10-10T16:36:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And I still have most of my blood still inside me. I should be fine.  
**2013-10-10T16:37:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Should  
**2013-10-10T16:38:11+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Maybe you should have some transfusions on hand.  
**2013-10-10T16:40:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'll just collect the blood as it comes out and recycle it.  
**2013-10-10T16:41:50+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I don't think that is the proper way to do it  
**2013-10-10T16:42:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's the way my grandpappy did it!  
**2013-10-10T16:45:41+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** where is he now?  
**2013-10-10T16:45:50+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Probably St Paul  
**2013-10-10T16:46:29+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** no the other one  
**2013-10-10T16:47:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The one that was a stickler for keeping his insides in? He's dead.  
**2013-10-10T17:14:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Why is it the conversation stops whenever I mention my dead grandfather?  
**2013-10-10T17:20:56+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Merlin Mann was on Unrecorded  
**2013-10-10T17:21:05+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** or rather wasn't?  
**2013-10-10T17:21:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That guy that talks into his shoe?  
**2013-10-10T17:21:27+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** No the guy who hates inboxes.  
**2013-10-10T17:21:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of the guy who hates oil cans  
**2013-10-10T17:46:32+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I'm thinking about writing a Apple pundit type blog post.  Where do I apply the shocks to get rid of this impulse?  
**2013-10-10T17:51:13+00:00** - **&lt;ruok&gt;** the genitals. always the genitals.  
**2013-10-10T17:52:19+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Doesn't work, trust me.  
**2013-10-10T17:52:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'd try the bathroom  
**2013-10-10T18:27:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** http://bridesthrowingcats.com/  
**2013-10-10T18:28:44+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** dot tumblr dot com  
**2013-10-10T18:29:39+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was disappointed by that.  
**2013-10-10T18:30:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I can't hear "h as in" without thinking Hammacher  
**2013-10-10T18:30:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Because people that work at Hammacher Schlemmer apparently lack imagination  
**2013-10-10T18:31:12+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** bless you  
**2013-10-10T18:31:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** !current  
**2013-10-10T18:31:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Did showbot say "Some show from 2 months ago"?  
**2013-10-10T18:32:00+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Speaking of showbot, _HolyCow, how did the phone call with Dan go?  
**2013-10-10T18:32:32+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** there was no phone call, we chatted over IRC  
**2013-10-10T18:32:39+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** that's Internet Relay Chat  
**2013-10-10T18:32:44+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** FYI  
**2013-10-10T18:33:15+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Who the hell uses IRC anymore?  
**2013-10-10T18:34:39+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** jerks  
**2013-10-10T18:34:52+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yeeeah.  
**2013-10-10T18:35:00+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Complete assholes.  
**2013-10-10T18:35:39+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I'm working on converting the web version to Rails because according to Dan "RAILS IS WIN"  
**2013-10-10T18:36:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You should do it all in perl and python  
**2013-10-10T18:37:07+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Just to irk him  
**2013-10-10T18:37:24+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** do not taunt happy fun ball  
**2013-10-10T18:37:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** PAN KISSES YOU!  
**2013-10-10T18:38:12+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** timer koala sing  
**2013-10-10T18:38:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Why can't people keep their willies out of holes?  
**2013-10-10T18:39:09+00:00** - **&lt;Henriok&gt;** Speaking about Federico now?  
**2013-10-10T18:39:45+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You lost me  
**2013-10-10T18:40:06+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** L O S T  
**2013-10-10T18:40:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** ** BOOM **  
**2013-10-10T18:40:42+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** WHAT?! NO WAY!!! I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK TO FIND OUT?!?! GOD DANG IT LOST!  
**2013-10-10T18:41:23+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Don't worry. It was probably some pseudoscience mixed with stunted spirituality  
**2013-10-10T18:42:23+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** smoke monsters killed my pa  
**2013-10-10T18:42:27+00:00** - *theTiger gives haroldina 3 Internet Points*  
**2013-10-10T18:42:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** "Turn the big steering wheel stuck into the rock to make magic happen!"  
**2013-10-10T18:43:47+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** http://i.imgur.com/aMEEQeK.jpg  
**2013-10-10T18:44:07+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Lost and Far Cry actually hit script ninjas in roughly the same way. In Far Cry, you start out as a guy stranded on an island with hostile forces and memory troubles.  
**2013-10-10T18:44:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Half-way through, you're suddenly fighting genetically modified monsters that can make themselves invisible.  
**2013-10-10T18:45:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That's some non-regulation pinata action, there.  
**2013-10-10T18:45:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But still a good picture.  
**2013-10-10T19:32:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yup. The contact cement headache is setting in.  
**2013-10-10T19:38:30+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Good afternoon quiesce.  
**2013-10-10T19:38:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** haroldina: Excellent.  
**2013-10-10T19:39:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Hello  
**2013-10-10T19:39:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's about time for me to get out of here and work on the car.  
**2013-10-10T19:40:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Which offers all different kinds of opportunities to injure myself.  
**2013-10-10T19:40:18+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Try not to grievously injure yourself.  
**2013-10-10T19:40:20+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Have fun, stay safe, etc.  
**2013-10-10T19:40:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm just hoping I don't have a repeat of this weekend when I dripped solder on my arm.  
**2013-10-10T19:40:49+00:00** - *theTiger picard-face-palms*  
**2013-10-10T19:41:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The perils of having to solder upside-down  
**2013-10-10T19:41:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** On the plus side, I wasn't wearing non-natural fibers, so it was just a small second-degree burn  
**2013-10-10T19:42:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Today I'll be reinstalling some suspension parts and doing a small amount of soldering  
**2013-10-10T19:42:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So we've got potential for cutting, crushing and burning.  
**2013-10-10T19:45:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Have I mentioned I got zinc poisoning because my friend was welding on the body of the car and I forgot to tell him it's galvanized?  
**2013-10-10T19:46:15+00:00** - *theTiger digs in his drawer for the number for the OSHA hotline.*  
**2013-10-10T19:46:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ladies?  
**2013-10-10T19:46:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Or is that "ladies."  
**2013-10-10T19:48:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I could totally be the basis of a sitcom character.  
**2013-10-10T19:49:13+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Perhaps you will be.  
**2013-10-10T19:49:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** A large guy who plays ukulele and gets injured all the time.  
**2013-10-10T19:49:26+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I mean, who wouldn't watch that?  
**2013-10-10T19:49:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Speaking of which: anybody want to buy a mandolin?  
**2013-10-10T19:49:52+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Possibly.  
**2013-10-10T19:50:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Details, please.  
**2013-10-10T19:50:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I can't get my fingers to fit on the fretboard.  
**2013-10-10T19:50:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Oh, it's a cheap starter. I believe it's a Rogue.  
**2013-10-10T19:50:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Has a hard case and a cheap tuner.  
**2013-10-10T19:50:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Ah, never mind then.  
**2013-10-10T19:51:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's a cheap one because we weren't sure if I'd be able to play it.  
**2013-10-10T19:51:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** same deal with one of my ukuleles  
**2013-10-10T19:51:15+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Quite reasonable  
**2013-10-10T19:51:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The other one is much nicer.  
**2013-10-10T19:51:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** (and a bit bigger)  
**2013-10-10T19:52:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** What I don't get is that Kevin Murphy can play the mandolin and it seems his hands are about the same size as mine.  
**2013-10-10T19:54:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** OK, I'm out. Somebody dial 91 and I'll let you know if I need the other 1.  
**2013-10-10T19:54:08+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Finger placement takes practice but at some point you are trading manual dexterity to make up for hand size.  
**2013-10-10T19:54:14+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** bye  
**2013-10-10T20:13:04+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The News 163 with @imyke - http://t.co/RjTps5C8eF (57 seconds ago)
