**2013-02-24 03:14:09 +0000** - **papyromancer:** what&apos;s a good alternative to coda for coding html/css on os-x?  
**2013-02-24 03:14:29 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i just use textwrangler  
**2013-02-24 03:14:51 +0000** - **crucialwax:** syntax highlighting. connects via ssh. i don&apos;t need any more than it does.  
**2013-02-24 03:15:20 +0000** - **papyromancer:** yeah, I favor the minimal myself, but looking for local "jsbin" for a friend  
**2013-02-24 03:19:37 +0000** - **papyromancer:** perhaps I&apos;m thinking of codekit?  
**2013-02-24 03:20:19 +0000** - **crucialwax:** don&apos;t know that one  
**2013-02-24 18:33:42 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** Critical Path begins momentarily  
**2013-02-24 18:36:33 +0000** - **showbot:** [@5by5](http://twitter.com/5by5): The Critical Path with @asymco &amp; @moiseschiu is starting now - [http://t.co/MErWLdtI4S](http://t.co/MErWLdtI4S) (27 seconds ago)  
**2013-02-24 18:38:23 +0000** - **palimondo:** Hi  
**2013-02-24 18:39:03 +0000** - **ebryn:** long time listener, first time live :)  
**2013-02-24 18:40:01 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** niiiice  
**2013-02-24 18:41:03 +0000** - **palimondo:** Yes it is a good listening time!  
**2013-02-24 18:45:35 +0000** - **Rom:** hello hello everyone  
**2013-02-24 18:45:45 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** good morning, weekend jackals  
**2013-02-24 18:48:33 +0000** - **palimondo:** moiseschiu: They said that in context of how much it cost them to develop it. They did not say it was more profitable than their big titles. I don&apos;t think that was the case at all  
**2013-02-24 18:49:37 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** palimondo: they said that if was a more efficient production to profit model  
**2013-02-24 18:49:38 +0000** - **palimondo:** [http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120308/infinity-blade-epic-games-most-profitable-game](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120308/infinity-blade-epic-games-most-profitable-game)  
**2013-02-24 18:49:49 +0000** - **palimondo:** Infinity Blade is "the most profitable game we&apos;ve ever made â€” in terms of man years invested versus revenue, it&apos;s more profitable than Gears of War."  
**2013-02-24 18:50:17 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** "Sweeney thinks the present $100-million-a-game development model isn&apos;t sustainable in the long run. He believes that the future of gaming is in freemium downloadable games and goes on to stress the importance of having one engine across all devices"  
**2013-02-24 18:50:36 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** "Although Epic has been an important ally for Microsoft in recent years, Sweeney told GDC that "you might in the future see the Epic relationship span different publishers and different platforms across the world.""  
**2013-02-24 18:51:59 +0000** - **palimondo:** &hellip;and we&apos;ve just copied the whole article in here! :-)  
**2013-02-24 18:52:33 +0000** - **palimondo:** [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/xbox.html](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/xbox.html)  
**2013-02-24 18:53:12 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** palimondo: extensive contextual investigation :)  
**2013-02-24 18:53:13 +0000** - **palimondo:** Hey, swilliams! :-D  
**2013-02-24 18:53:24 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** well now it&apos;s a party if swilliams is here  
**2013-02-24 18:53:59 +0000** - **swilliams:** i gotta figure out how to stop that irc auto-login when my computer wakes up...  
**2013-02-24 18:54:01 +0000** - **swilliams:** :-D  
**2013-02-24 18:54:09 +0000** - **palimondo:** moiseschiu: &hellip;the two of us, with our speculative google searches are approaching the Google Now level of helpfilness  
**2013-02-24 18:54:45 +0000** - **palimondo:** swilliams: Don&apos;t you date to leave now! ;-)  
**2013-02-24 18:56:16 +0000** - **palimondo:** moiseschiu: Was this theme (PS4, consoles) premeditated with Horace, or did you just jump it on him now?  
**2013-02-24 18:56:27 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** PS4 specifically  
**2013-02-24 18:56:37 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** I raised it as our opening point  
**2013-02-24 18:56:53 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** I&apos;m continuing this thread on Screen Time next week with Rene Ritchie from iMore  
**2013-02-24 18:57:04 +0000** - **palimondo:** Nice  
**2013-02-24 18:59:18 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** !s The Third Horse  
**2013-02-24 19:19:12 +0000** - **palimondo:** That was deep! "When talent leaves, the customers will follow" --@asymco  
**2013-02-24 19:19:46 +0000** - **palimondo:** Rovio is outlier  
**2013-02-24 19:19:49 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** one of the best pull quotes ever from him  
**2013-02-24 19:19:52 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** I agree  
**2013-02-24 19:20:21 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** they&apos;re an outlier because no one else is attacking it from the comprehensive angle they are  
**2013-02-24 19:20:30 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** there will be more Rovios  
**2013-02-24 19:20:45 +0000** - **palimondo:** I disagree. The are the 1% oa App Store  
**2013-02-24 19:22:10 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** there is a methodology there that many have stated a desire to duplicate, but that they simply haven&apos;t  
**2013-02-24 19:22:14 +0000** - **palimondo:** We have 2 plush Angry Birgs toys (2 kids), and I definitely paid more for those physical items than for the iOS games!  
**2013-02-24 19:22:26 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** exactly  
**2013-02-24 19:22:46 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** their strategy has been about all that revenue diversification from the beginning  
**2013-02-24 19:23:31 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** "Rovio slides over a piece of paper" love it  
**2013-02-24 19:25:20 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** !s Lovable is not Easy  
**2013-02-24 19:25:57 +0000** - **palimondo:** IIRC angry birds creation was accidental&hellip; let me find that interview  
**2013-02-24 19:26:35 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** well, I define the beginning from the explosive popularity point  
**2013-02-24 19:27:11 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** they leveraged that once it became an actual vehicle for success  
**2013-02-24 19:27:52 +0000** - **palimondo:** Oh, sure. Once they gained traction, deer execution has been excelent.  
**2013-02-24 19:28:04 +0000** - **palimondo:** Gaining the traction is the tricky part  
**2013-02-24 19:33:21 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** they were the starting point of this whole potential market segment and defined it  
**2013-02-24 19:42:07 +0000** - **palimondo:** Re: Rovio&apos;s success was accidental&hellip; [http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/04/features/how-rovio-made-angry-birds-a-winner?page=all](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/04/features/how-rovio-made-angry-birds-a-winner?page=all)  
**2013-02-24 19:42:30 +0000** - **palimondo:** "First they had to save a company in crisis: at the beginning of 2009, Rovio was close to bankruptcy. Then they had to create the perfect game, do every other little thing exactly right, and keep on doing it. The Heds had developed 51 titles before Angry Birds"  
**2013-02-24 19:43:09 +0000** - **palimondo:**  One afternoon in late March, in their offices overlooking a courtyard in downtown Helsinki, Jaakko Iisalo, a games designer who had been at Rovio since 2006, showed them a screenshot. He had pitched hundreds in the two months before. This one showed a cartoon flock of round birds, trudging along the ground, moving towards a pile of colourful blocks. They looked cross. "People saw this picture and it was just magical," says Niklas. Eight mont  
**2013-02-24 19:43:10 +0000** - **palimondo:** and thousands of changes later, after nearly abandoning the project, Niklas watched his mother burn a Christmas turkey, distracted by playing the finished game. "She doesn&apos;t play any games. I realised: this is it."  
**2013-02-24 19:43:10 +0000** - **Bamurphymac:** 52nd time&apos;s the charm.  
**2013-02-24 19:49:00 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** yup, and upon that success, they became a different company, leveraging the capital of their success  
**2013-02-24 19:49:49 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** in the same way that Amelio-led Apple was a different company than Jobs-led 1997 Apple  
**2013-02-24 19:58:36 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** in the same way countries are often are defined by their rulers (Hirohito&apos;s Japan, etc), the eras within tech and telecom are much shorter, but I think analyzed along similar lines  
**2013-02-24 19:59:25 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** there&apos;s the sentimental brand association from the consumer standpoint, and then there&apos;s the business focus drive  
**2013-02-24 19:59:42 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** for example, HP&apos;s radical series of changes over the last ten years  
**2013-02-24 20:00:22 +0000** - **cr1:** dont treat it as isolated to just companies, moiseschiu. the future successful companies are those that creat techno-political alliances. Chinese companies succeed because they partner with their government  
**2013-02-24 20:01:49 +0000** - **cr1:** always a great show, moiseschiu and horace  
**2013-02-24 20:02:13 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** I agree  
**2013-02-24 20:02:35 +0000** - **cr1:** later all  
**2013-02-24 20:02:52 +0000** - **palimondo:** Nice show. I&apos;m looking forward to re-listening once its out. I&apos;m too distracted during live show to catch all of Horace&apos;s nuance.  
**2013-02-24 20:03:06 +0000** - **palimondo:** moiseschiu: When will it be out?  
**2013-02-24 20:03:18 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** in a few hours  
**2013-02-24 20:03:22 +0000** - **palimondo:** Last time it took quite a while, didn&apos;t it?  
**2013-02-24 20:03:59 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** palimondo: editor was really jammed up  
**2013-02-24 20:04:38 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** CP is in first position for post, followed by Giant Size and then Screen Time  
**2013-02-24 20:04:47 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** so CP is the next to go up  
**2013-02-24 20:04:59 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** we may be live later with Comic Shack, talking about Batman  
**2013-02-24 20:05:14 +0000** - **palimondo:** Thanks for the show!  
**2013-02-24 20:06:01 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** thanks for listening to 5by5&apos;s now Sunday-specific show  
**2013-02-24 20:06:18 +0000** - **moiseschiu:** Meet the Analysis with Horace Dediu  
**2013-02-24 20:56:03 +0000** - **ChadwickWill:** hey fellas
