**2013-09-09T02:07:31+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: Mac Power Users 154 with @macsparky &amp; @katiefloyd - http://t.co/IvrhbgDXth (59 seconds ago)  
**2013-09-09T13:02:25+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Possibly Haddie-less Frequency… And B2W during the Apple keynote. Going to be an interesting week at 5by5. :)  
**2013-09-09T13:07:36+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I think they're doing a special right after the announcement, so it seems Dan will have to watch live  
**2013-09-09T13:37:22+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** !seen haddiebird  
**2013-09-09T13:37:25+00:00** - **&lt;haveyouseenbot&gt;** [2013-09-03T18:52:54+00:00] haddiebird was seen in #5by5 saying 'nerddotis nope! I'm still awake!'  
**2013-09-09T13:37:50+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** 6 days again. :)  
**2013-09-09T13:37:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** ago**  
**2013-09-09T13:40:47+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** She twittered that she had 4x less wisdom.  But if she started with 4 wisdom teeth and had them all taken out, then she would be 1x or 100% less wise.  
**2013-09-09T13:43:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You could put a hyphen between the 'less' and 'wisdom' and make it some kind of esoteric RPG spell unit.  
**2013-09-09T13:43:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Dentist casts EXTRACTION on Haddie; She takes 1d8 damage and 4 less-wisdom.  
**2013-09-09T13:52:29+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** she could turn the teeth into some 20 sided dice  
**2013-09-09T14:18:52+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Oh Apple… You make me specify the United State as the country of service and then transfer me to the European team in Cork anyway. :)  
**2013-09-09T14:18:57+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Never change.  
**2013-09-09T14:19:35+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Happy Monday, quiesce.  
**2013-09-09T14:20:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Happy still alive, tiger.  
**2013-09-09T14:21:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Indeed, indeed. The first two session of DnD have come and gone and everyone's still alive. :D  
**2013-09-09T14:23:09+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I lack context for that. Defaulting to calling you a nerd and pretending I know what is going on.  
**2013-09-09T14:25:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That works. :)  
**2013-09-09T14:25:34+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** morning, gents  
**2013-09-09T14:26:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Morning prehnra.  
**2013-09-09T14:27:39+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** There are no gents here. Just Jackles, Nerds, and half-breeds.  
**2013-09-09T14:33:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm a Half-Jackal Cleric  
**2013-09-09T14:33:26+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh, I am actually playing a cleric. :D  
**2013-09-09T14:33:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm not playing anything right now.  
**2013-09-09T14:34:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My last 2 were monks, though.  
**2013-09-09T14:34:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** High level monks never feel as powerful as they are when you're playing them, but you get to watch everybody else react to the crazy shit you can do.  
**2013-09-09T14:38:34+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I favour Bards or similar.  
**2013-09-09T14:42:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I prefer non-casters just because there's less paperwork.  
**2013-09-09T14:42:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** If I'm going to play a caster, I want it to be one of the classes with spontaneous casting.  
**2013-09-09T14:45:29+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I like having a healthy amount of skill points and performing makes up for the casting limitations if you favour a support role as I do.  
**2013-09-09T15:18:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Man, I hate concealed damage.  
**2013-09-09T15:22:18+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** nerds  
**2013-09-09T15:22:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** And we are nerds.  
**2013-09-09T15:22:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Sorry, I switched topics.  
**2013-09-09T15:22:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But yes, I am a nerd.  
**2013-09-09T15:53:52+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** wow guys  
**2013-09-09T15:54:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Sir?  
**2013-09-09T15:54:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Guhwhanow?  
**2013-09-09T15:54:20+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** hai  
**2013-09-09T15:54:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** !bluetoot  
**2013-09-09T15:54:28+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** Before you answer, Hi!  
**2013-09-09T15:54:30+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** the #1 one way to ensure that someone walks up and asks for a consultation is to send something to the chat  
**2013-09-09T15:54:46+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** that  
**2013-09-09T15:54:55+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** 's why i always drive-by the chat room  
**2013-09-09T15:55:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That explains all the bullet holes.  
**2013-09-09T15:55:32+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** that is just part of the charm  
**2013-09-09T15:55:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yeah, I just assume everyone has better things to do than IRC… >.> ;)  
**2013-09-09T15:55:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Better, but not more fun  
**2013-09-09T15:56:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've had to send a bunch of pictures of damaged product today.  
**2013-09-09T15:56:27+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** yeah, sorry about that  
**2013-09-09T15:56:33+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-09T15:56:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** One was a chair that had a slice in the upholstery  
**2013-09-09T15:56:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And it was boxed up and shipped that was.  
**2013-09-09T15:56:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** way  
**2013-09-09T15:56:45+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** again, i said i'm sorry  
**2013-09-09T15:56:51+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-09T15:56:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yes, you said, but I still don't believe you.  
**2013-09-09T15:57:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm still mad at you for taking away all my beautiful curse words.  
**2013-09-09T15:57:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** People look at me funny when I exclaim "beaver biscuits!"  
**2013-09-09T15:57:57+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** hahaha  
**2013-09-09T15:58:04+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i have them all to myself!  
**2013-09-09T15:58:17+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** you should have them back soon, the aeropress is on the mend  
**2013-09-09T15:58:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've been doing cold brew coffee the last couple weeks.  
**2013-09-09T15:58:55+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i like that too  
**2013-09-09T15:59:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just wish I had some bigger filters.  
**2013-09-09T15:59:24+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** what is your cold brew set up?  
**2013-09-09T15:59:26+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've been lining a strainer with smaller ones  
**2013-09-09T15:59:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** A couple pitchers and a strainer.  
**2013-09-09T15:59:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** with some coffee filters in it.  
**2013-09-09T15:59:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Oh, and a wood spoon for stirring.  
**2013-09-09T16:00:02+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** ok  
**2013-09-09T16:00:09+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** yeah i did that until i got married  
**2013-09-09T16:00:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm not some fancy city lawyer with an A-Row-Press.  
**2013-09-09T16:00:15+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** then someone gave us a toddy  
**2013-09-09T16:00:35+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** haroldina: haha  
**2013-09-09T16:00:58+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i think we've discussed– you don't have the proper facilities at work for aeropressing, right?  
**2013-09-09T16:01:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I could, but it would mean filtering water to both make the coffee and clean the aeropress.  
**2013-09-09T16:01:28+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** as in, you have a "does that look clean to you"-style sink  
**2013-09-09T16:01:39+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** you are correct, sire.  
**2013-09-09T16:01:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** sir.  
**2013-09-09T16:01:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you just got a promotion  
**2013-09-09T16:01:49+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** haha  
**2013-09-09T16:01:53+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** good  
**2013-09-09T16:01:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My fingers are a little hierarchy-happy  
**2013-09-09T16:02:05+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i've been missing promotions since i went freelance  
**2013-09-09T16:02:16+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just got my first raise in about 5 years.  
**2013-09-09T16:02:24+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** oh, congrats  
**2013-09-09T16:02:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's not much, but everything helps  
**2013-09-09T16:02:32+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** yes  
**2013-09-09T16:03:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Nothing is clean.  
**2013-09-09T16:03:27+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i know.  
**2013-09-09T16:03:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I submitted my cut hand picture to Does That Look Clean To you  
**2013-09-09T16:03:52+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** that's why i can't have one of those scorpion lights that dan and merlin were talking about  
**2013-09-09T16:04:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm so behind on my podcasts.  
**2013-09-09T16:04:31+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** me too  
**2013-09-09T16:04:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I have 5 episodes of the Frequency on my iPod right now.  
**2013-09-09T16:04:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That SHOULD be why you care a LOT less about it. Your body is well-tuned to deal with the world around us.  
**2013-09-09T16:04:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But somehow only 1 episode of B2W  
**2013-09-09T16:05:12+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** when i had a stooge job i listened a lot more  
**2013-09-09T16:05:18+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** i have trouble hearing talking while i work  
**2013-09-09T16:05:33+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** and when i was at StoogeCo, i didn't really care  
**2013-09-09T16:05:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm mainly having trouble keeping up because I get 5 episodes of Hypercritical every time I sync my iPod  
**2013-09-09T16:05:46+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** but i give me clients all my attention  
**2013-09-09T16:06:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger: I think I need to lay down.  
**2013-09-09T16:06:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I understood all the words, but I think I missed the context.  
**2013-09-09T16:06:17+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** you may be stuck in a chrono-bubble  
**2013-09-09T16:06:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Hmm. I may need one of these Toddy things.  
**2013-09-09T16:06:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That would cut down on a hell of a lot of labor.  
**2013-09-09T16:07:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** As it stands, I have to spend about 20 minutes filtering the stuff manually.  
**2013-09-09T16:07:41+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** CONTEXT: quiesce: Nothing is clean // prehnra: I know // theTiger: {Then don't worry about it}  
**2013-09-09T16:08:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ah. I thought you were talking about me and my sink.  
**2013-09-09T16:08:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm a little concerned, though. This suggests not everything is about me.  
**2013-09-09T16:09:41+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** everything IS about you, it is just that the value of 'you' varies from person to person  
**2013-09-09T16:09:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Mind: blown  
**2013-09-09T16:10:05+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** boom!  
**2013-09-09T16:10:29+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** See also: You don't know where I've been.  
**2013-09-09T16:10:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You've got that right.  
**2013-09-09T16:11:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** OK, why the hell didn't I think to submit the picture of my sink to Does That Look Clean To You?  
**2013-09-09T16:13:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Also, I'm a little surprised Merlin didn't reply when I sent him this picture: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Iaypcx4XMtQ/Uhk6lmnWMII/AAAAAAAAApM/_mglXqwX_B8/w423-h563-no/IMG_20130706_193236-MOTION.gif  
**2013-09-09T16:15:14+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** Must Investigate Further  
**2013-09-09T16:15:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-09T16:15:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Just remember: Cosplay is not consent.  
**2013-09-09T16:15:50+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It is not.  
**2013-09-09T16:16:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just thought he'd like a belly-dancing Phoenix  
**2013-09-09T16:16:50+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** theTiger: word!  
**2013-09-09T16:18:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Actually, I think it was this one that I shared: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pz6StXEKGFg/Uhk6LAdwSXI/AAAAAAAAAog/8Sls3uQpmpM/w383-h563-no/IMG_20130706_201143.JPG  
**2013-09-09T16:19:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** She was the only mixed-geekery act in the show.  
**2013-09-09T16:19:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Everybody else's geek subject was just belly dance in general.  
**2013-09-09T16:21:33+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Interesting show.  
**2013-09-09T16:21:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was mainly just there because one of our friends was performing.  
**2013-09-09T16:22:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Otherwise, I had a panel I would have been at.  
**2013-09-09T16:22:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** There for and/or with a friend. Of course.  
**2013-09-09T16:23:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm actually not into the shows they put on. The women that run it are much more into forcing audience participation than I like.  
**2013-09-09T16:23:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Because picking on introverts bugs the crap out of me.  
**2013-09-09T16:23:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** (mainly because I am one)  
**2013-09-09T16:24:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Agreed. But, at the same time, I know that I can have fun if poked a bit from time to time.  
**2013-09-09T16:24:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I generally just shut down.  
**2013-09-09T16:25:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And get pissed off.  
**2013-09-09T16:25:31+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I do often do the first.  
**2013-09-09T16:26:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I try to avoid that kind of instinctual reaction to varying degrees of success.  
**2013-09-09T16:26:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Same, here.  
**2013-09-09T16:26:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I took a camera to my last con to give me something 'to do'.  
**2013-09-09T16:26:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** theTiger: Because we are friends, I will hold my tongue. If only just.  
**2013-09-09T16:27:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The only reason I was OK with going to this performance is because it was in a large area instead of the tiny room it usually is in.  
**2013-09-09T16:27:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Which comment was that directed to?  
**2013-09-09T16:28:08+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** poking introverts  
**2013-09-09T16:28:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Good lord. Phrased that way, it makes me want to say something, too.  
**2013-09-09T16:29:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :( Didn't mean that literally or disrespectfully. Just offer the opportunity without pressure.  
**2013-09-09T16:30:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Let's just all hug quietly and pretend this never happened.  
**2013-09-09T16:30:49+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Very well.  
**2013-09-09T16:30:58+00:00** - *theTiger is hugged and doesn't know why.*  
**2013-09-09T16:32:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ah, hugging.  
**2013-09-09T16:32:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I like it, but was very surprised when one of my wife's cousins insisted on a hug.  
**2013-09-09T16:32:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's the sort of family where men touching is restricted to handshakes.  
**2013-09-09T16:36:13+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** There is very little spoken or physical affection in my family. Everytime I hug someone I feel like I am rebelling against my parents.  
**2013-09-09T16:38:34+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Dad's a hugger… I fake it.  
**2013-09-09T16:38:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I take after my dad in that I find it hard to show my affection verbally, but I'm fine with it physically.  
**2013-09-09T16:38:59+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** It's hit-or-miss throughout the rest of the family tree.  
**2013-09-09T16:41:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm primarily a verbal guy… (I'm also an aural learner, so that might just make sense.)  
**2013-09-09T16:41:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, I'm more of a tactile/visual learner  
**2013-09-09T16:42:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Let's get a government grant to research this.  
**2013-09-09T16:42:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker can do the data work for us. ;-)  
**2013-09-09T16:42:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** damn right  
**2013-09-09T16:46:48+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Sign me up for "mildly disgruntled and ultimately forgotten co-founder".  
**2013-09-09T16:47:06+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Who said that?  
**2013-09-09T16:47:26+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The non-Steve founder of Apple?  
**2013-09-09T16:47:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It wasn't a quote, yet.  
**2013-09-09T16:48:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** There's that noise again.  
**2013-09-09T16:48:13+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** And I happen to be a non-Steve.  
**2013-09-09T16:48:23+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It all works out.  
**2013-09-09T16:48:48+00:00** - *haroldina is totally making this "forgetting quiesce" joke*  
**2013-09-09T16:48:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne <--- He's also gay  
**2013-09-09T16:49:23+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** No comment. >_>  
**2013-09-09T16:51:53+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ugh. Is the day over yet?  
**2013-09-09T16:52:07+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** never  
**2013-09-09T16:52:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Man...  
**2013-09-09T16:52:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I want to go take a nap  
**2013-09-09T16:52:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'll give Monday this… It's not dragging today. >.>  
**2013-09-09T16:53:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I got 2 deliveries I was expecting and one I wasn't. The rest of the day is cleaning around the warehouse.  
**2013-09-09T16:54:03+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I thought it was the 9th two days ago so I am have a three-day dragend.  
**2013-09-09T16:54:21+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** ^having  
**2013-09-09T16:54:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I didn't realize Friday was the 6th until my sister tweeted about it.  
**2013-09-09T16:54:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** 9/6 was my mom's birthday.  
**2013-09-09T16:54:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm pretty sure I still thought it was July  
**2013-09-09T16:55:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Because there's no possible way it could be September yet.  
**2013-09-09T17:05:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ooh! Our hug analyst is here!  
**2013-09-09T17:06:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker: haroldina, quiesce and I have a hypothesis we think you can test for us. :)  
**2013-09-09T17:06:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** due tell  
**2013-09-09T17:06:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** do*  
**2013-09-09T17:07:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Oh, crap  
**2013-09-09T17:07:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Does this wind up with me being injured?  
**2013-09-09T17:07:26+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** deux tell  
**2013-09-09T17:07:34+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Primary learning styles correlate to later ability to express express affection.  
**2013-09-09T17:07:59+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** For example, I'm an aural learner and I express affection primarily verbally.  
**2013-09-09T17:08:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** haroldina is a tactile learner and expresses affection primarily physically.  
**2013-09-09T17:09:09+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** whahoa!  
**2013-09-09T17:10:07+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** there are no learning styles  
**2013-09-09T17:10:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** at least not discrete one likes that  
**2013-09-09T17:10:29+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger: this is what we get for asking someone who actually knows about education.  
**2013-09-09T17:10:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** there are modes for transmitting information and people will freely choose to learn different ways  
**2013-09-09T17:10:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but there's no evidnce you learn better through your chosen mode  
**2013-09-09T17:10:46+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** you end up learning just as well no matter how  
**2013-09-09T17:10:57+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** thats what I tried to tell them  
**2013-09-09T17:10:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** most consistent thing is exposure through multiple ways of expression is better than just 1  
**2013-09-09T17:11:08+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker: You take a lot of fun out of this. ;-)  
**2013-09-09T17:11:10+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but little evidence that a particular single leanring style exists for someone  
**2013-09-09T17:11:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** _HolyCow: apple polisher  
**2013-09-09T17:11:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-09T17:13:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker: But thanks for the knowledge. :)  
**2013-09-09T17:13:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** pleasure  
**2013-09-09T17:13:55+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh5jxgKucL1qdjt2eo1_400.jpg  
**2013-09-09T17:14:03+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** No porn  
**2013-09-09T17:14:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Kind of sinks the whole study when both just come down to preference.  
**2013-09-09T17:14:07+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** not porn  
**2013-09-09T17:14:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I thought you said not porn!  
**2013-09-09T17:14:30+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** porn is subjective  
**2013-09-09T17:14:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I know it when I see it and I just saw it.  
**2013-09-09T17:15:01+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Look at those beards just ripe for fetishising.  
**2013-09-09T17:15:01+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Seems like that would be some necessary condition. >.>  
**2013-09-09T17:15:53+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I bet Yahoo! is happy that I assume every link to a tumblr image is porn.  
**2013-09-09T17:16:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Like this one?  
**2013-09-09T17:16:36+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** http://25.media.tumblr.com/5c8fd868e7aa8b9b7eee84399ce3e809/tumblr_mrwlxmIDLr1qjzlg7o1_500.jpg  
**2013-09-09T17:16:56+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** not clicking  
**2013-09-09T17:17:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** How about this? http://25.media.tumblr.com/11acfe35818221f4301ee56b39e393e0/tumblr_mnjehkMvQc1qjzlg7o2_500.jpg  
**2013-09-09T17:17:40+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** nope  
**2013-09-09T17:18:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** This one? http://25.media.tumblr.com/7e744b29b1964ffa65dca0a63e8bdf3f/tumblr_mgy9xa8AsR1qjzlg7o3_500.jpg  
**2013-09-09T17:18:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Fair warning, they're all mine.  
**2013-09-09T17:19:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Oddly enough, though, none of them involve any of my body parts being injured.  
**2013-09-09T17:19:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You're not helping your case.  
**2013-09-09T17:19:39+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Yours?  Now I feel weird about ogling all that hardware.  
**2013-09-09T17:20:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, those are all crappy pictures I took.  
**2013-09-09T17:20:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Mainly because people I know wanted to see progress on my car.  
**2013-09-09T17:21:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** While reaching for a different UI element, I hit the CLEAR button in Colloquy. I'm choosing to view this as fortuitous.  
**2013-09-09T17:22:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm guessing all my pictures are actually SFW unless you work for an environmental firm.  
**2013-09-09T17:23:27+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I lost my "car" in an accident so I couldn't post pictures if I wanted to.  
**2013-09-09T17:23:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've got pictures of the damage from all the accidents I've been in.  
**2013-09-09T17:25:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm hoping we'll be able to start that car within the next couple weeks.  
**2013-09-09T17:27:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** And with that I imagining this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLjNzwEULG8 but with people swapping phones and silently looking at pictures of one another.  
**2013-09-09T17:27:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm currently listening to Dan laughing about honeypots  
**2013-09-09T17:31:11+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** guys i'm at the stooge job in a meeting taking notes. this pornblr posting is not ok  
**2013-09-09T17:32:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I don't think anybody has yet.  
**2013-09-09T17:33:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** See… The 'yet' there is why I don't click on these links. :D  
**2013-09-09T17:34:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Gotcha. Use URL obfuscation when posting porn to the chat room.  
**2013-09-09T17:39:02+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** ponyhoot  
**2013-09-09T17:39:23+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** poneyhots  
**2013-09-09T17:39:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Sounds like a fugue state  
**2013-09-09T17:40:26+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** hootypens  
**2013-09-09T17:40:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Minky Boodle?  
**2013-09-09T17:40:46+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** pootyhens  
**2013-09-09T17:43:56+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** honeypots.pro is available  
**2013-09-09T17:44:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** There's a noodle in my strudel and its name is Minky Boodle.  
**2013-09-09T17:44:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Stroke?  
**2013-09-09T17:44:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Space Ghost  
**2013-09-09T17:44:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So, basically the same thing  
**2013-09-09T17:46:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And now on to posting Craig's List ads because I'm bored with cleaning.  
**2013-09-09T17:47:52+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** selling stuff?  
**2013-09-09T17:48:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yup  
**2013-09-09T17:48:07+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I've been doing a lot of that too  
**2013-09-09T17:48:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Not trolling  
**2013-09-09T17:48:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm actually copying the ones my boss posted and I'm taking over those duties.  
**2013-09-09T17:50:16+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Hmm… Dan's at Elevation Burger. Guess The Freq will be late today. :D  
**2013-09-09T17:53:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** He doesn't have Haddie to whip him into shape today.  
**2013-09-09T18:02:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Siracusa is winning the day with this tweet: https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/377128973194764288  
**2013-09-09T18:04:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm very happy to see Craig's List has accounts now.  
**2013-09-09T18:22:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just rented some chairs to pick up tomorrow for use on Wednesday morning, hung up and then had to call back because I couldn't remember if I said I needed to pick them up tomorrow.  
**2013-09-09T18:23:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** This humidity is killing my brain.  
**2013-09-09T18:25:20+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** did you upload any doesthatlookcleantoyou yet?  
**2013-09-09T18:27:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yes, 2  
**2013-09-09T18:28:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Only one was approved so far, though.  
**2013-09-09T18:28:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And it was the second one.  
**2013-09-09T18:28:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm guessing my hand won't make it.  
**2013-09-09T18:28:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** which one is yours, the deepsink?  
**2013-09-09T18:28:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yup  
**2013-09-09T18:28:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger best tweet ever  
**2013-09-09T18:29:15+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Your hand one constitutes gore if it's anything like the one I think you showed us already  
**2013-09-09T18:30:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think the toilet with the toilet seat off is so nope I just wouldn't have to go anymore  
**2013-09-09T18:30:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's the same one, but there's dirt involved.  
**2013-09-09T18:30:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** the "pre-irrigation" shot. I could never do that. I never think about a camera before basic first aid  
**2013-09-09T18:31:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Actually, that's after I'd cleaned it up a bit.  
**2013-09-09T18:32:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It was just before I put tape on the gauze to drive myself to the clinic.  
**2013-09-09T18:32:19+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** duct tape and kleenex  
**2013-09-09T18:32:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Sorry, strike that. That was at the clinic after I took the gauze off  
**2013-09-09T18:32:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So I could show the nurse.  
**2013-09-09T18:32:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And before the doctor came back into the room.  
**2013-09-09T18:33:02+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and get saline solution instead of pink bathoom soap. smart move  
**2013-09-09T18:34:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I wrapped it up with a sterile gauze pad and medical tape, even.  
**2013-09-09T18:34:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It was hell keeping it dry for a week, though.  
**2013-09-09T18:35:58+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I know someone that just cuts the fingers off nitrile gloves  
**2013-09-09T18:39:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think all my gloves had holes in them  
**2013-09-09T18:40:18+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** He has gout, so he just put the finger tips on only to keep them dry and irritant free  
**2013-09-09T18:40:46+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think that's what I would do to keep stitches safe if it came up  
**2013-09-09T18:41:07+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** but I don't have enough scars so I think i'd just duct tape it up and see what happens  
**2013-09-09T18:43:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I also have gout, but I don't need to keep my toes dry because of it.  
**2013-09-09T18:43:36+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** !current  
**2013-09-09T18:43:36+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** this guy has it in his hands too  
**2013-09-09T18:43:53+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** his elbows look like baseballs  
**2013-09-09T18:44:07+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The location of my cut would require a full glove., but the gloves I wore ended up just trapping sweat.  
**2013-09-09T18:44:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** yeah that's a pain  
**2013-09-09T18:44:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you just can't win  
**2013-09-09T18:44:41+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ugh. I'm lucky. I get occasional flare-ups that are treated with anti-inflamitory drugs.  
**2013-09-09T18:44:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** talc powder maybe, but after a few hours...  
**2013-09-09T18:45:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, then it's just mineral paste.  
**2013-09-09T18:45:15+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** yeah, he's almost 80 but he has been saying he doubts he'll make it another year for the past 20  
**2013-09-09T18:45:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My in-laws are like that with their marriage.  
**2013-09-09T18:45:38+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ha  
**2013-09-09T18:46:03+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** We were told we'd better show up for their 30th anniversary party because there probably wouldn't be another one.  
**2013-09-09T18:46:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I try not to think too hard about that one.  
**2013-09-09T18:46:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** "You wanna go to the moon?!?"  
**2013-09-09T18:47:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** "We're celebrating this thing neither of us can stand, so you'd better be there for the last crappy party before we call it a day."  
**2013-09-09T18:47:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** What?  
**2013-09-09T18:47:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** how long ago was that?  
**2013-09-09T18:47:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think about 5 years.  
**2013-09-09T18:49:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you didn't get that quote? I thought I was a young'n  
**2013-09-09T18:49:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Bang, zoom!  
**2013-09-09T18:50:06+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Also, I think you're thinking of The Young Ones  
**2013-09-09T18:51:30+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think you're thinking of Young Riders  
**2013-09-09T18:53:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Nicolas Cage  
**2013-09-09T18:53:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you're thinking of John Travolta.  
**2013-09-09T18:53:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Olivia Newton John  
**2013-09-09T18:54:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you're thinking of Gene Kelly.  
**2013-09-09T18:54:39+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Gene Autry  
**2013-09-09T18:55:01+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** abort Haroldina, I repeat, abort  
**2013-09-09T18:55:20+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** you do not want to chase thetiger down this path  
**2013-09-09T18:55:36+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Is country music another hot button issue that was before my time?  
**2013-09-09T18:55:46+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Oh wait, I'm thinking of Tucker. Carry on.  
**2013-09-09T18:56:06+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you're thinking of Howdy Doody.  
**2013-09-09T18:56:12+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I think you  
**2013-09-09T18:56:18+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** 're thinking of Hee Haw  
**2013-09-09T18:56:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you might being thinking of Laugh-In.  
**2013-09-09T18:56:53+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Man, you killed my Marion Barry reference.  
**2013-09-09T18:57:25+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** aw  
**2013-09-09T18:58:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** probably would've gone over my head  
**2013-09-09T18:58:17+00:00** - *AlbatrossD drops the mic and drops the bass*  
**2013-09-09T18:58:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Although, I guess he was the one calling somebody else a "Howdy Doody-looking nimrod" so it wouldn't have been quite right.  
**2013-09-09T18:58:50+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Also, Jackie Gleason was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.  
**2013-09-09T18:59:01+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** not related, not the same era, not the same class  
**2013-09-09T18:59:14+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** but you ever seen the extras on Barber Shop?  
**2013-09-09T18:59:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've never seen the movie itself, but I think I may have seen some of the extras.  
**2013-09-09T18:59:42+00:00** - *AlbatrossD looks at 11:58 and shakes his head*  
**2013-09-09T18:59:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Soaps --> Ghost Rider --> Face/Off --> Grease --> Xanadu --> "Gene" --> Singing Cowboys --> Cowboy Variety Shows --> Early 70s TV  
**2013-09-09T18:59:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Jackals… I'm impressed. :)  
**2013-09-09T19:00:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But I might be thinking of Eddie Murphy in Coming to America  
**2013-09-09T19:00:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Thetiger I didn't get my Xanadu reference in...  
**2013-09-09T19:00:25+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger: And I didn't get my politics in there, either.  
**2013-09-09T19:00:26+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** my head might actually explode  
**2013-09-09T19:00:46+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** haroldina technicall MArion Barry  
**2013-09-09T19:01:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, I'm not counting that as being in there.  
**2013-09-09T19:01:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Since you put HeeHaw where Marion Barry was going to go.  
**2013-09-09T19:02:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And this might be the only situation where those are interchangable.  
**2013-09-09T19:02:18+00:00** - *AlbatrossD initials the transcript and moves on to the next issue*  
**2013-09-09T19:02:24+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** noted  
**2013-09-09T19:03:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I may be a simple seabird...  
**2013-09-09T19:03:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** ...but I am more than a little familiar with socio-economic issues as they relate to variety televsion  
**2013-09-09T19:04:38+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** MAtlock, Diagnosis Murder, Coach  
**2013-09-09T19:04:41+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** discuss  
**2013-09-09T19:05:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** TV My Parents Like  
**2013-09-09T19:05:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** TV on TV Land  
**2013-09-09T19:05:13+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** correct  
**2013-09-09T19:05:15+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Lessee... Andy Griffith, Dick van Dyke and Jerry van Dyke  
**2013-09-09T19:05:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** also, crackerjack Bingo team  
**2013-09-09T19:05:34+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I liked Matlock  
**2013-09-09T19:05:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I like yelling MAAATLOOOOOOOOOCK  
**2013-09-09T19:06:11+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I liked Coach and Diagnosis muder and LITERALLY every time the Van Dyke brothers cameoed the others' show  
**2013-09-09T19:06:26+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I saving that for when he finally takes me down.  
**2013-09-09T19:06:39+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** But it hurt my head watching Andy Griffith do anything at any age  
**2013-09-09T19:06:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I liked Coach at the time, but I didn't know MN State University was a real thing at the time  
**2013-09-09T19:07:23+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My dad worked at the University of Minnesota and I thought they were being willfully obtuse  
**2013-09-09T19:07:23+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I didn't know a Rug Doctor could remove grape juice  
**2013-09-09T19:07:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** so  
**2013-09-09T19:07:41+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It didn't go to 8 years of rug medical school not to.  
**2013-09-09T19:08:12+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** Erm, so.  
**2013-09-09T19:08:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** !vanhoet  
**2013-09-09T19:08:56+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I get the idea that Dr Pepper is very effective but Mr Pibb has more fun  
**2013-09-09T19:09:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** What about Prof Cumin?  
**2013-09-09T19:09:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Man, these pictures are taking forever to upload  
**2013-09-09T19:09:54+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** inscrutable  
**2013-09-09T19:10:04+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** oddly enough, I'm having a hard time chosing a spice joke  
**2013-09-09T19:10:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm cheating by cribbing from Merlin  
**2013-09-09T19:10:44+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I'm more than ready to pounce on the unfortunate soul that tries to use an herb though...  
**2013-09-09T19:10:59+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I forgot the Prf Cumin that's great  
**2013-09-09T19:11:16+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** sound like a Walgreen's idea  
**2013-09-09T19:11:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** TA Corriander?  
**2013-09-09T19:12:06+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** RN Alspice?  
**2013-09-09T19:12:34+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Joseph Pepper, ESQ  
**2013-09-09T19:12:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** CPA Clove  
**2013-09-09T19:12:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** at Jon's market  
**2013-09-09T19:13:15+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** is this live?  
**2013-09-09T19:13:21+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** Dr A+ from ALbertson's is hilarious  
**2013-09-09T19:13:33+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** It doesn't feel live  
**2013-09-09T19:13:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I have no headphones. :(  
**2013-09-09T19:13:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The Live light is not on.  
**2013-09-09T19:14:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, this isn't live  
**2013-09-09T19:14:20+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** yeah, the not greedy joke  
**2013-09-09T19:14:31+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** and it's not August  
**2013-09-09T19:14:55+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** QU  
**2013-09-09T19:14:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's also not Quit! like iTunes is reporting.  
**2013-09-09T19:14:57+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** IT!  
**2013-09-09T19:15:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I like how Dan started threatening to end Quit!  
**2013-09-09T19:15:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Although, I'm listening to the 8/12 episode on my iPod, so I was thinking "of course it isn't live, it's on my iPod."  
**2013-09-09T19:15:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That just means it's a real show now. He only threatens to end the ones that go well.  
**2013-09-09T19:16:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Has everyone seen this yet: http://5by5.tv/radar ?  
**2013-09-09T19:16:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You know Dan… If you wanted to be on Geek Friday again, I bet they'd let you. ;-)  
**2013-09-09T19:17:08+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** First one should be Jsir and Merlin  
**2013-09-09T19:17:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger: I would so much prefer him to start another show.  
**2013-09-09T19:17:31+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Not of Jason/Faith fan?  
**2013-09-09T19:17:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Not what I've heard.  
**2013-09-09T19:17:51+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I actually can't stand Jason and Faith I'm really sorry  
**2013-09-09T19:18:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm sure they have a good time making it and other people might like it, but I can't listen to it.  
**2013-09-09T19:18:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** confession time SO MUCH dead air  
**2013-09-09T19:18:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I will admit that it took me a couple of episodes, but I like their shtick.  
**2013-09-09T19:18:28+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** LAme joke/ dead air / Faith giggling  
**2013-09-09T19:18:42+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** are they in the room together?  
**2013-09-09T19:18:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You forgot Faith saying "Jason"/dead air/Jason saying "Faith"  
**2013-09-09T19:18:58+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** cuz maybe he's tickling her and they have to mute it  
**2013-09-09T19:19:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm pretty sure they're in different states, but use video chat.  
**2013-09-09T19:19:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Nope. Faith's in Austin and Jason is in Orlando. They talk about Skype.  
**2013-09-09T19:19:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was just going to say I thought she was in Austin and he was somewhere in Florida.  
**2013-09-09T19:19:35+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** they talk about Skype while on Skype?  
**2013-09-09T19:19:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Of course.  
**2013-09-09T19:19:49+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Like talking about ADN on Twitter.  
**2013-09-09T19:19:52+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I gotta go to lunch  
**2013-09-09T19:20:03+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** No freq for me today  
**2013-09-09T19:20:30+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** I always leave abruptly so I'm gonna do that lingering thing  
**2013-09-09T19:20:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** heh  
**2013-09-09T19:20:45+00:00** - *AlbatrossD check fingernails*  
**2013-09-09T19:20:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just got what is my new favorite spam.  
**2013-09-09T19:20:56+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** okay se  
**2013-09-09T19:21:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** from "Health Nutrition News"  
**2013-09-09T19:21:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The subject line is "Do you POOP enough?"  
**2013-09-09T19:27:16+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I try to avoid the shift to uppercase at such delicate times.  
**2013-09-09T19:27:19+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** I listen to Geek Friday at 3x  
**2013-09-09T19:27:47+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** where did theTiger find that Radar link?  
**2013-09-09T19:28:04+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** On the Homepage.  
**2013-09-09T19:28:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** It's it in the grid.  
**2013-09-09T19:28:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So it is.  
**2013-09-09T19:28:46+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** oh, so I can act like I know it exists  
**2013-09-09T19:29:04+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** if it's in the grid, then it probably starts soon  
**2013-09-09T19:29:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** That's the only place I've seen it or heard it mentioned.  
**2013-09-09T19:29:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've heard the usual "thing I can't talk about yet" stuff lately.  
**2013-09-09T19:29:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But nothing specific, of course.  
**2013-09-09T19:30:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I figured they were going to put their stock of stickers for sale or something.  
**2013-09-09T19:30:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** After Big Week, I'll wait for the show to start. ;-)  
**2013-09-09T19:31:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** MoisesChiu_ isn't there a screen time coming soon?  
**2013-09-09T19:31:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm dying to listen  
**2013-09-09T19:32:08+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** actually, ditto that Giant Size  
**2013-09-09T19:32:11+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** because I love Image  
**2013-09-09T19:33:25+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** jbecker: in theory. trying to get both posted, but they were both complicated in different ways  
**2013-09-09T19:34:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just picked up 9 issues of Hawkeye on Saturday, but 8 and 10 weren't in stock when they ordered them for me.  
**2013-09-09T19:34:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So I'm stuck at 7 until 8 comes in.  
**2013-09-09T19:34:49+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** editor can't find the Giant Size file, and there was a giant mountain of crosstalk on Screen Time that may not be clean-up-able  
**2013-09-09T19:34:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But at least I'm glad I have them.  
**2013-09-09T19:35:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I've got the first two TBPs of Hawkeye waiting for me to get to… I just finished Vol 1 of Saga yesterday. >.>  
**2013-09-09T19:35:33+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** MoisesChiu_ does that mean the Giant Size is lost, or delayed?  
**2013-09-09T19:35:42+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** just delayed  
**2013-09-09T19:35:48+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger now you're catching up. Seriously.  
**2013-09-09T19:35:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Good to know.  
**2013-09-09T19:36:02+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** should have been up same day  
**2013-09-09T19:36:30+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm current on Saga. and I'm |-| <that close to setting up a pull list.  
**2013-09-09T19:36:30+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Sorry, jbecker. I don't like comics typically. >.>  
**2013-09-09T19:37:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** But I bought them for a guy for his birthday and thumbed through them… >.>  
**2013-09-09T19:37:16+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I thought I didn't like comics, but once I realized "comics" isn't a genre, I found some I really got into.  
**2013-09-09T19:37:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** With the "help" of Merlin and MoisesChiu_  
**2013-09-09T19:37:50+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** the Image episode we did on Saturday will be a really bad thing for your bank account  
**2013-09-09T19:37:57+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** It's not a genre thing… It's a medium thing. I (for instance) tried reading Sandman and couldn't do it. >.>  
**2013-09-09T19:38:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm guessing I wouldn't like Sandman either.  
**2013-09-09T19:38:20+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** Sandman is totally not for everyone  
**2013-09-09T19:38:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I only got 3 pages into American Gods.  
**2013-09-09T19:38:35+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I stopped and started reading the first volume more time than I could count and just couldn't follow it and stay interested.  
**2013-09-09T19:38:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Sandman is fucking brilliant, but not for everyone  
**2013-09-09T19:38:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I like American Gods, so go figure … *shrugs*  
**2013-09-09T19:38:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And I generally power through books I don't like.  
**2013-09-09T19:38:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I've REALLY enjoyed Saga though. :)  
**2013-09-09T19:38:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** For me, Watchmen, which I think is generally a bad introduction, was critical to getting me to read comics  
**2013-09-09T19:39:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Saga is what pulled me in.  
**2013-09-09T19:39:18+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** not a pre-announcement, but…I might be setting up an X-Men episode for last week of the month  
**2013-09-09T19:39:27+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and the reason is because Watchmen does a lot of things that make it very clear that a graphic story is the only way to achieve what they sought to achieve  
**2013-09-09T19:39:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :)  
**2013-09-09T19:39:46+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** deciding how to time it relative to Battle of the Atom  
**2013-09-09T19:39:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** before Watchmen, I always thought a novel or a movie would be superior to tell all stories… I just couldn't understand why you would NEED to tell a story in comic form  
**2013-09-09T19:40:15+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** After that, it's just been a matter of finding the right stuff. The only DC or Marvel comic I've ever read is Fraction's Hawkeye  
**2013-09-09T19:40:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** All I know of X-Men is the movies and what Merlin has posted on tumblr.  
**2013-09-09T19:40:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** If I only ever saw typical Marvel and DC stuff I'd never read comics  
**2013-09-09T19:40:39+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Well, I'm familiar with the cartoon versions. >.>  
**2013-09-09T19:40:46+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** jbecker: read Superior Foes of Spider-Man. the hook of it is xeroxed from Hawkeye  
**2013-09-09T19:40:48+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Sandman is also a bit of a slow burner… in that some of the best stuff comes pretty deep  
**2013-09-09T19:41:14+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm through Volume 2 of Absolute Sandman… I buy and read one every 6months or so  
**2013-09-09T19:41:24+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** for me, it's some of the greatest stories ever told  
**2013-09-09T19:41:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Anywho, I've got to step over to the retail store and assist on the bench. Catch y'all later. :)  
**2013-09-09T19:41:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** MoisesChiu_ there you go, spending my money again. I'll put it on the wishlist, since I don't have to buy an STID bluray now  
**2013-09-09T19:41:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've never been a Gaiman fan, so I haven't looked into it at all.  
**2013-09-09T19:42:55+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina see, I read American Gods and Neverwhere when they came out and loved them and have been hooked on Gaiman since  
**2013-09-09T19:43:11+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** The Ocean at the End of the Lane might be his best work  
**2013-09-09T19:44:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I managed to get through Neverwhere, but I didn't enjoy it.  
**2013-09-09T19:44:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Much like Fellowship of the Ring.  
**2013-09-09T19:44:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And I swear I'm not trolling.  
**2013-09-09T19:45:11+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** for the first time ever, I may end up finding the iTunes download to be what makes most sense if you're buying STID at all  
**2013-09-09T19:45:25+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Fellowship of the Ring film or book? I find Tolkien hard to read, personally.  
**2013-09-09T19:45:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** LotR also isn't for everyone.  
**2013-09-09T19:45:47+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** MoisesChiu_ without an Apple TV I'm holding out for some uber set in a few years  
**2013-09-09T19:46:12+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** it's crazy that iTunes Extras are not available on ATV  
**2013-09-09T19:46:16+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** just crazy  
**2013-09-09T19:46:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** jbecker: book.  
**2013-09-09T19:46:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Like The Hunger Games, I liked the movie much better.  
**2013-09-09T19:47:02+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** jbecker: totally insane. why have them? they don't work on iDevices either!  
**2013-09-09T19:47:23+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina for me, Tolkien is like reading Homer. Love the stories, but the writing isn't great.  
**2013-09-09T19:47:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** jbecker: if he wasn't dead, I would have hunted him down for writing Tom Bombadil  
**2013-09-09T19:47:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** ugh. Who the hell wants to be at their desk using a consumer-grade LCD monitor to watch special features  
**2013-09-09T19:48:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I have a computer hooked up to my TV, so it'd work alright for me.  
**2013-09-09T19:48:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Assuming I wanted to give the iTunes store any more money than I had to.  
**2013-09-09T19:48:44+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** MPU spent 1.5 hrs talking about the ATV yesterday and all it did was remind me how much better the Roku is for a cord cutter  
**2013-09-09T19:48:53+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** We bought season 7 of Dr Who from iTunes and they don't even sort correctly by episode number.  
**2013-09-09T19:49:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** MPU?  
**2013-09-09T19:49:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ah, got it.  
**2013-09-09T19:49:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm resigned to buying bluray and ripping until Amazon creates a new locker service like they did with music and books  
**2013-09-09T19:49:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Amazon has worked hard at making me regret using other channels for any of my media  
**2013-09-09T19:49:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I usually enjoy the show when I catch it, but don't subscribe.  
**2013-09-09T19:49:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina i subscribe, but don't always listen  
**2013-09-09T19:50:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** There are Macs in my house, but I don't typically use any of them, so I don't think it's aimed at me.  
**2013-09-09T19:50:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** No I wouldn't say so  
**2013-09-09T19:52:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My wife has a Mini in her sewing room, and I think it's still on whichever cat was before Lion. Snow Leopard?  
**2013-09-09T19:52:55+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** really?  
**2013-09-09T19:52:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Yikes.  
**2013-09-09T19:53:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Snow Leopard  
**2013-09-09T19:53:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** we're all apple at work and at home.  
**2013-09-09T19:53:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** having the terminal alone is worth the price of admission. Not to mention how much better, IMO, the laptops are  
**2013-09-09T19:54:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I like the hardware and the OS is fine, but I got burned with a first gen Macbook.  
**2013-09-09T19:54:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Every single update broke something.  
**2013-09-09T19:55:16+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Which I think is a pretty big counterpoint to the "just works" thing.  
**2013-09-09T19:55:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was at the point where I would wait to install a release until it had been out for months  
**2013-09-09T19:55:49+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** thigns can be weird like that. my last W7 box required a reinstall of the OS every 4-5 months just to keep wifi working  
**2013-09-09T19:56:33+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I have had far fewer issues, personally. I went Windows - > Linux -> Windows -> OSX  
**2013-09-09T19:56:34+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** The cool kid "power user" thing to do now is complain about how Snow Leopard was the last good OS X so be sure to tell your wife how cutting edge her computer is.  
**2013-09-09T19:56:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** very happy  
**2013-09-09T19:56:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** quiesce those kids are annoying and wrong  
**2013-09-09T19:57:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm not saying my case was representative, but I also figure that I can do what I need to on Windows and I don't have to pay as much for the hardware.  
**2013-09-09T19:57:11+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That would be the joke, yes.  
**2013-09-09T19:57:14+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** that last windows was more dual booting  
**2013-09-09T19:57:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My wife is free to update the OS on her Mini if she wants.  
**2013-09-09T19:57:36+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's her machine.  
**2013-09-09T19:58:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Sure. Different strokes. I can get everything done I do on any OS, the most important applications I use are cross-platform.  
**2013-09-09T19:58:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Exactly. I can understand why someone would prefer OS X.  
**2013-09-09T19:58:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** But stepping out from a key core of apps, everything 1 level deeper I find better options on OSX  
**2013-09-09T19:58:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** had Monarch happened with Windows  
**2013-09-09T19:58:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** i might be more open  
**2013-09-09T19:59:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** if someone made hardware I liked  
**2013-09-09T19:59:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm in terminal a lot  
**2013-09-09T19:59:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I had Terminal in my dock when I had my Macbook.  
**2013-09-09T20:00:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Sadly, a lot of that was for killing processes quickly, though.  
**2013-09-09T20:00:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haha  
**2013-09-09T20:00:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The machine is still in the family.  
**2013-09-09T20:00:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My wife's aunt bought it as a graduation present for her daughter  
**2013-09-09T20:00:36+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I never owned oneof those plastic bodies… my first was a Macbook Pro 13" at some point  
**2013-09-09T20:00:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And I used the money to buy an Android tablet.  
**2013-09-09T20:00:51+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I've had several minis (all post aluminum) and MBPs and MBAs  
**2013-09-09T20:01:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I wanted a Pro, but I wanted a 13" screen more.  
**2013-09-09T20:01:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And the smallest Pro at that point was 15"  
**2013-09-09T20:01:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** yeah 15" is crazy  
**2013-09-09T20:01:27+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** biggest laptop I had was a 14" T43  
**2013-09-09T20:01:56+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I had a 15" 4:3 Dell and currently have a 15" dell in 16:9, but I got this one for free.  
**2013-09-09T20:02:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I knew somebody who had one of those 19" monstrosities.  
**2013-09-09T20:02:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just don't get why one would buy something like that.  
**2013-09-09T20:02:44+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** so silly  
**2013-09-09T20:03:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** She could barely lift the thing, so it's not like she was going to carry it around with her.  
**2013-09-09T20:04:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Anyway, I realized the other day that my media box is still running the hard drive out of an XBox 360  
**2013-09-09T20:04:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's 120GB, SATA 1 and something like 4200RPM  
**2013-09-09T20:05:14+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I thought I'd picked up a bigger, faster drive for it and only realized that was still in there because it was taking forever for iTunes to load so I could watch Dr Who.  
**2013-09-09T20:05:21+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I had a 17" monstrosity as my first laptop, for college.  
**2013-09-09T20:05:34+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** 17" Gateway, and despite Gateway making terrible desktops, that laptop was always solid.  
**2013-09-09T20:06:01+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** But it was effectively bolted to my desk.  
**2013-09-09T20:06:16+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I built my own computer in high school and someone told me to buy one from Gateway instead because it came in a cow box.  
**2013-09-09T20:06:23+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** HAH.  
**2013-09-09T20:06:37+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** We had those cow boxes all over my high school. Every computer was a Gateway.  
**2013-09-09T20:06:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I still have a machine using that CPU, RAM and motherboard.  
**2013-09-09T20:07:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina you sound a little pack-ratty  
**2013-09-09T20:07:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You should see all the crap I've gotten rid of.  
**2013-09-09T20:08:03+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I built a desktop and bought a laptop for college  
**2013-09-09T20:08:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** had Dells before that mostly  
**2013-09-09T20:08:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Really, I don't have that much stuff that isn't still in use.  
**2013-09-09T20:08:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** a gateway and build your own in between  
**2013-09-09T20:08:34+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Today I was just thinking about how I can't wait to get another Macbook Pro, so I can use the one I'm using now for other stuff.  
**2013-09-09T20:08:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** then at some point just after college the Dell I picked up with W7 was cheaper than the same machine on Newegg parts  
**2013-09-09T20:08:49+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** so I went back briefly and ran into all kinds of problems  
**2013-09-09T20:08:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** A couple PowerMacs in the basement and a couple SMP motherboards screwed to the wall in my computer room.  
**2013-09-09T20:08:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** been mostly solid mac after that point  
**2013-09-09T20:08:59+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Just as excited for that as for the performance increase of the new one.  
**2013-09-09T20:09:10+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I don't have a lot of use for extra machines  
**2013-09-09T20:09:23+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** The one thing I'll probably do is plug my current mini into my tv after a haswell one comes out  
**2013-09-09T20:09:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** But even then, my Roku covers me like 98% of the way with a lot less fussing  
**2013-09-09T20:10:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I have a server (that I should really just retire), my network gateway (that I should really retire), the main desktop, the wife's mini and the media box in the living room.  
**2013-09-09T20:10:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** what's the value in the network gateway? and what are you using the server for?  
**2013-09-09T20:10:44+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I just want to turn this machine into a local test server for the minecraft server  
**2013-09-09T20:10:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** No value, really.  
**2013-09-09T20:10:47+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm thinking about just getting a Synology and not even bothering with the mini  
**2013-09-09T20:10:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** yeah  
**2013-09-09T20:11:28+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** The server is doing my e-mail, my (horrible) website and media  
**2013-09-09T20:11:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** In fact, depending on how much I can get for the mini the Synology is almost definite a better way to go. Want a NAS anyway. That plus Plex and Roku and no need for anything ese  
**2013-09-09T20:11:44+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** yeah. I gave up on doing my own email and website a while ago  
**2013-09-09T20:12:11+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I should really just do a NAS, an off-the-shelf router and some cheaper internet access and call it a day.  
**2013-09-09T20:12:18+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Have Hover do my e-mail  
**2013-09-09T20:12:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haha yeah. I just switched to fasmail recently  
**2013-09-09T20:12:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Get rid of the websites I don't use anymore.  
**2013-09-09T20:12:34+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** very happy with that  
**2013-09-09T20:12:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** especially if the main thing is having a good wired router  
**2013-09-09T20:12:56+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** There's a lot of things I "should really just do"  
**2013-09-09T20:12:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** it's cheap as hell at this point  
**2013-09-09T20:13:02+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** ...that I keep putting off.  
**2013-09-09T20:13:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My gateway is a SunFire V100 running FreeBSD  
**2013-09-09T20:13:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** So not only is it more work than required for what I do, it's also loud as hell.  
**2013-09-09T20:14:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** For a while, I had some ex-Atari network switches  
**2013-09-09T20:14:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** (which I got when they closed down their MN office)  
**2013-09-09T20:16:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** wow. Well with that I'm out of here. But yikes. I hope you have many basement closets  
**2013-09-09T20:18:36+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I need new software to waste my time with. Suggestions?  
**2013-09-09T20:18:58+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** What's new the last six months that my life has been eaten by urgent stuff.  
**2013-09-09T20:19:08+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Take up a hobby.  
**2013-09-09T20:20:22+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think jbecker imagines I have more stuff or less room than I have.  
**2013-09-09T20:21:20+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I only know of http://rogueamoeba.com/intermission/  
**2013-09-09T20:22:13+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Oh, cool. I hadn't seen this one yet.  
**2013-09-09T20:22:16+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Thanks.  
**2013-09-09T20:22:41+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I have lots of other hobbies. That's what's eating my life lately. Sometimes I just want to tinker in front of my computer though :)  
**2013-09-09T20:23:20+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That page has a red banner for me reading "It looks like you’ve got a pre-release version of Mac OS X (10.9). Please note that this product has not yet been fully certified to run on this OS." I am impressed by the attention to detail.  
**2013-09-09T20:24:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Have you seen http://shortcatapp.com?  
**2013-09-09T20:25:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Alright, I'm leaving.  
**2013-09-09T20:25:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Later, Jackals.  
**2013-09-09T20:25:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Very much not for everyone, but I love it.  
**2013-09-09T20:25:49+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Bye  
**2013-09-09T20:26:17+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Whaaat. This is awesome.  
**2013-09-09T20:26:28+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Getting this now.  
**2013-09-09T20:26:53+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I never got into Keyboard Maestro, is it similar?  
**2013-09-09T20:27:31+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Oh, I see what it's doing. Wow, that's neat.  
**2013-09-09T20:58:32+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** jbecker: the only thing I have to use ATV for is iTunes Library, which is where I've iFlicks-ed all my content  
**2013-09-09T20:59:10+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** I have a Transporter now, but not going to use its tiny drive for that. Maybe comics.  
**2013-09-09T20:59:32+00:00** - **&lt;MoisesChiu_&gt;** if luck holds out, my special guest for Screen Time this week is The Digital Bits' Bill Hunt
