**2013-10-09T09:15:56+00:00** - **&lt;rice&gt;** rice 19 f from philippines looking for decent and respectful friends rude pple stay away from me i will never entertain  u  ok  
**2013-10-09T16:00:38+00:00** - **&lt;mikeyR&gt;** anybody know is Amplified is going to be live today?  
**2013-10-09T16:01:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** With Dan traveling in NYC, I doubt it, but you never know.  
**2013-10-09T16:03:33+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** سلام  
**2013-10-09T16:03:38+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** خوبید؟  
**2013-10-09T16:03:50+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** اینجا ایرانی هست؟  
**2013-10-09T16:04:10+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** کسی نیست؟  
**2013-10-09T16:04:12+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** الوووووووووووو  
**2013-10-09T16:04:15+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** هههههههههههههههههههه  
**2013-10-09T16:04:21+00:00** - **&lt;Shervin_&gt;** اینا مجازین؟  
**2013-10-09T16:05:35+00:00** - *theTiger has the sudden feeling to bomb a government building with the aim of killing innocent civilians with little or no cognizable political reason.*  
**2013-10-09T16:06:37+00:00** - *theTiger waves to the NSA agent now review this IRC transcript.*  
**2013-10-09T16:06:44+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** </sarcasm>  
**2013-10-09T17:48:56+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I don't want none unless you got puns hun!  
**2013-10-09T18:06:03+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The News 162 with @imyke - http://t.co/gRnKUriyEc (1 second ago)  
**2013-10-09T18:35:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** so is 5by5 closed for the week?  
**2013-10-09T18:35:17+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Pretty much.  
**2013-10-09T18:35:31+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The UK Division seems unaffected.  
**2013-10-09T18:35:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** A lot of inconsistency lately :/  
**2013-10-09T18:35:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Was hoping to go to a NYC meet up as well… but haven't seen any details  
**2013-10-09T18:35:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm gonna be down there Thursday and Friday  
**2013-10-09T18:36:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You're not alone in wanting details.  
**2013-10-09T18:36:26+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** abolishme tweeted at Dan as well.  
**2013-10-09T18:36:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** But, yeah… Dan's priorities are made abundantly clear. Heh.  
**2013-10-09T18:38:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Maybe things will get better after some of this travel lets up.  
**2013-10-09T18:39:11+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm hopeful, but meh  
**2013-10-09T18:39:26+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** 2013 hasn't been a great year at 5by5. Should have been. I'm hoping the new staff will help[p  
**2013-10-09T18:55:55+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** I still miss The Crossover  
**2013-10-09T18:56:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Just hard to schedule, I imagine.  
**2013-10-09T18:56:40+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** that and Screen Time are the main shows I followed after Marco and John ended their runs, and neither has been updating frequently  
**2013-10-09T18:57:01+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** although I guess I still follow Incomparable  
**2013-10-09T18:57:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Screen Time will have another episode soon.  
**2013-10-09T18:58:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Moisés has been working on another project. (Which based on hints and such seems to be a documentary film of some kind.)  
**2013-10-09T19:00:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Though I'm not sure he still has any idea what that show is actually about. :D  
**2013-10-09T19:02:45+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I suspect it has to do with Wendy Davis, fyi  
**2013-10-09T19:03:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but he says screen time and giant size are gertting uptdates soon Shinohara, because he did a bunch of interviews at Dallas ComicCon  
**2013-10-09T19:03:39+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** jbecker: That was my guess as well… Timing works out a little bit too well with her announcement recently.  
**2013-10-09T19:03:40+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** maybe he's working on her campaign for governor  
**2013-10-09T19:03:49+00:00** - *theTiger nods.*  
**2013-10-09T19:03:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I know he was involved in some of the protesting  
**2013-10-09T19:04:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and him being pretty secretive about what's going on  
**2013-10-09T19:04:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** A -> B  
**2013-10-09T19:04:07+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** He's very keen on turning Texas back to blue.  
**2013-10-09T19:04:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** So… GO HIM!  
**2013-10-09T19:04:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I miss Crossover a lot too, I think it's one of the best ideas they've had and I was hoping with the post-iPhone announcement there was hinting at more cross-show panels  
**2013-10-09T19:04:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** "The most forward thinking episode on 5by5"  
**2013-10-09T19:04:45+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I hope the project he's working on is getting them to reprint Hawkeye issues 8 and 10  
**2013-10-09T19:04:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I've loved Merlin sorta hopping around … many when he used to be Merlin Mann he was pretty good at this stuff eh  
**2013-10-09T19:05:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I only know Merlin post… book breakdown  
**2013-10-09T19:05:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina the TPBs are so cheap  
**2013-10-09T19:05:16+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I know it's not the same  
**2013-10-09T19:05:17+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh. :/  
**2013-10-09T19:05:21+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** you may get a second printing  
**2013-10-09T19:05:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've already purchased 1-7, 9 and 11.  
**2013-10-09T19:05:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I felt/feel sorry for him.  
**2013-10-09T19:05:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I'm also a huge Generational fan  
**2013-10-09T19:05:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And all of them are 2nd, 3rd or 4th printings.  
**2013-10-09T19:05:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and that's on a hiatus  
**2013-10-09T19:05:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** How much of Generational is parenting?  
**2013-10-09T19:06:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My comic shop says they've checked and they said there won't be any more printings.  
**2013-10-09T19:06:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger I sorta got the story in bits and pieces but figured it out now  
**2013-10-09T19:06:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger pretty much 0  
**2013-10-09T19:06:14+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina ebay?  
**2013-10-09T19:06:23+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** (Though I do want to listen to that episode on programing that Terpstra and them did.)  
**2013-10-09T19:06:29+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** jbecker: TPBs before eBay, for sure.  
**2013-10-09T19:06:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger It's not about parenting at all  
**2013-10-09T19:07:45+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Weird. Guess I misread or mistook the description a long time back. :D  
**2013-10-09T19:07:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I was also hoping that iMyke would do more produced work like he said he wnated to  
**2013-10-09T19:08:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I would really love for some real produced 5by5 content  
**2013-10-09T19:08:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Just a matter of time and money for iMyke, no?  
**2013-10-09T19:08:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** by that i mean heavily produced… possibly some scripted stuff  
**2013-10-09T19:08:23+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Would that stuff be more like RadioLab?  
**2013-10-09T19:08:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** He's still got his day job.  
**2013-10-09T19:08:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina yeah  
**2013-10-09T19:08:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** True  
**2013-10-09T19:08:39+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** but not doing the backend stuff was supposed to allow for time for that  
**2013-10-09T19:08:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and I love The Prompt, which I think was envisioned ot be a place to start with that with the correspondents and segments  
**2013-10-09T19:09:06+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'd be OK if it was toned down a bit from what RadioLab does. I think they're a bit overproduced.  
**2013-10-09T19:09:11+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** But it hasn't fulfilled that quite  
**2013-10-09T19:09:16+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** haroldina: That's on purpose though.  
**2013-10-09T19:09:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina yeah I mean that's an extreme end. And part of what they are  
**2013-10-09T19:09:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** theTiger: They make their show sound bad on purpose?  
**2013-10-09T19:09:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** To some extent, yes.  
**2013-10-09T19:09:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** This American Life, The Dinner Party or whatever… other NPR stuff is probably a better measure  
**2013-10-09T19:09:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I find it fatiguing to listen to.  
**2013-10-09T19:10:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina I think it sounds great :). But they're purposely playing with what they can do with audio  
**2013-10-09T19:10:37+00:00** - **&lt;trpstra1&gt;** 5by5 needs a Dinner Party. That show is awesome.  
**2013-10-09T19:10:44+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think it's nice that they're playing with the format, but I'm fine with not listening to it.  
**2013-10-09T19:12:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** trpstra it is a great show, and a format that could work well on 5by5  
**2013-10-09T19:12:31+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Another example would be the Steve Jobs episode… special 3 I think… maybe 4  
**2013-10-09T19:12:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I've never heard of Dinner Party before now… How did this happen!  
**2013-10-09T19:12:57+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** it worked really well to just have a bunch of folks record a few minutes on their own with Dan sorta introducing them etc  
**2013-10-09T19:13:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Is Dinner Party just hosted by people who eat on-air? Like Gruber and Zeldman?  
**2013-10-09T19:13:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** There are ways that with more "central" 5by5 staff, as is coming down the pipe, they could get a lot more awesome shit out of their hosts and put it otgether in great ways without increasing burden on hosts by much  
**2013-10-09T19:13:51+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haroldina no… it's more like they structure the conversation like it's a mock dinner party… with courses and stuff relating to segments  
**2013-10-09T19:14:01+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** and an ambiance, audio wise, that evokes that metaphor  
**2013-10-09T19:14:12+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** similie? analogy? whatever  
**2013-10-09T19:14:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** simile*  
**2013-10-09T19:14:24+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Milieu?  
**2013-10-09T19:14:31+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I think you're thinking of Miley  
**2013-10-09T19:14:42+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Hannah  
**2013-10-09T19:14:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I think you're thinking of Hamon  
**2013-10-09T19:15:05+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Dan Harmon  
**2013-10-09T19:15:07+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** also know as jámon  
**2013-10-09T19:15:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I think you're thinking of Dungeons and Dragons  
**2013-10-09T19:15:25+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I should re-watch Hanna.  
**2013-10-09T19:15:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Monte Cook's World Of Darkness  
**2013-10-09T19:16:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I think you're thinking of Conway's Game of Life  
**2013-10-09T19:16:32+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think you're thinking of Tim Conway  
**2013-10-09T19:16:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Son of a bitch. Roderick is going to be in town on Friday  
**2013-10-09T19:16:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Maybe you're thinking of Tim Curry?  
**2013-10-09T19:16:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And I'm broke until Tuesday  
**2013-10-09T19:17:02+00:00** - **&lt;Abdel&gt;** Amplified late?  
**2013-10-09T19:17:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Abdel: Dam  
**2013-10-09T19:17:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm guessing no Amplified.  
**2013-10-09T19:17:22+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Abdel: Dan's in NYC, so probably not recording live.  
**2013-10-09T19:17:31+00:00** - **&lt;Abdel&gt;** Ah.  
**2013-10-09T19:57:23+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I think you're thinking of KFC  
**2013-10-09T19:57:49+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think I'm thinking that fixing the back door on the truck was a pain in the ass.  
**2013-10-09T19:58:02+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** not familiar with their work  
**2013-10-09T19:58:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Count yourself lucky  
**2013-10-09T20:02:34+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** jbecker: You need to have your Macbook checked for narcolepsy  
**2013-10-09T20:02:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** "I step away from the computer to take a breath"  
**2013-10-09T20:06:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Jackal rain!  
**2013-10-09T20:06:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I got nothin'  
**2013-10-09T20:07:07+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** jackal rain was the correct response  
**2013-10-09T20:07:10+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** I award you 2 points  
**2013-10-09T20:07:21+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I just couldn't follow up with anything,.  
**2013-10-09T20:07:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** "Hanging out in IRC again"  
**2013-10-09T20:07:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** See, that's what makes a good team  
**2013-10-09T20:08:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** So, with those 2 points, Carl… How are our panelists doing?  
**2013-10-09T20:08:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I mean, rhyme, meter, relevance  
**2013-10-09T20:08:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm just glad I didn't score a skunk-boy  
**2013-10-09T20:08:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** theTiger: Mo Rocca has 6, haroldina has 5, and jbecker is up the rear with 2 points  
**2013-10-09T20:08:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** How the hell is Mo in the lead?  
**2013-10-09T20:08:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** haha  
**2013-10-09T20:09:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I think I skipped 4 episodes of Wait Wait  
**2013-10-09T20:09:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Next up: Lightning Fill in the Blank wherein Peter Sagal gently nudges the panelists with hints in order to illicit correct responses.  
**2013-10-09T20:10:04+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I'm not sure I've ever heard a hint in Lightning Fill In The Blank  
**2013-10-09T20:10:16+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** He's usually pretty brutal.  
**2013-10-09T20:10:27+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Which just makes up for the rest of the show.  
**2013-10-09T20:10:51+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** The evolution I went through  
**2013-10-09T20:10:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** from really hating WWDTM  
**2013-10-09T20:11:01+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** to loving it  
**2013-10-09T20:11:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** over the course of like… 6 weeks  
**2013-10-09T20:11:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** heh  
**2013-10-09T20:11:10+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** was quite remarkable
