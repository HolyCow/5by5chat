**2013-05-26T16:56:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** someone go get me some  
**2013-05-26T17:12:49+00:00** - **&lt;uv_&gt;** I'm pretty sure that Microsoft's Head of Entertainment is extremely entertaining!

**2013-05-26T17:16:57+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Not to our knowledge.  
**2013-05-26T17:17:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Moisés is though.  
**2013-05-26T17:17:51+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Thanks  
**2013-05-26T17:19:56+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** theTiger, you look forward to WWDC?  
**2013-05-26T17:20:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yes and no. I'm looking forward to a preview of the new rev of iOS. However, I think that it will be boring product-wise.  
**2013-05-26T17:21:34+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm mostly curious to see what Apple thinks is really important to emphasise to devs in the new mobile environment.  
**2013-05-26T17:22:27+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Yeah, I hope they got something amazing to release for developers, like opening up for Apple TV.  
**2013-05-26T17:22:56+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** But I guess it´s unlikely.. iCloud surprises would be nice  
**2013-05-26T17:24:01+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I´m probably the only one who things 2013 will be an amazing year for Apple, like 2007 was in terms of surprises...  
**2013-05-26T17:24:37+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I like when they are quiet.  
**2013-05-26T17:25:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** :) I agree on that. The less I hear out of Apple the more excited I get.  
**2013-05-26T17:25:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** My gut tells me that next year will be the big year, but I don't have anything to back that up.  
**2013-05-26T17:26:59+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I would like them to completely surprise everyone with something nobody thought about.  
**2013-05-26T17:28:11+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I´m hoping that might be a new way to power devices, fuel cells for instance..  
**2013-05-26T17:29:21+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** being able to power an iphone/ipad/macbook for weeks instead of hours, and no more "recharging" battery.  
**2013-05-26T17:30:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Well, if I didn't have to pay $50+ for first-run games, then I would not be interested in the used-game market.  
**2013-05-26T17:30:10+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** a lot of interesting patents from Apple about this lately, and one of the major technical challenges would be the enclosure, but I think got the solution in ceramic/liquidmetal  
**2013-05-26T17:30:39+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** But I lag about three years behind in my own gaming and it's easier to find the titles I want for less money on the third-party market. >.>  
**2013-05-26T17:31:17+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** It would be interesting to see how Apple would fold that kind of tech into their product line, hydr.  
**2013-05-26T17:35:00+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I know the new OS X will be to my liking, so I'm not worried. Anything else good is a bonus.  
**2013-05-26T17:35:03+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Apple is underrated in the media,market and generally for their amazing innovative style. Time and again we see this...  
**2013-05-26T17:44:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** !s Please Argue with Me  
**2013-05-26T17:45:09+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** You´ll still have a gaming system in your home, even for the masses.  
**2013-05-26T17:45:42+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I think the future will be driven by companies like SuperCell etc.  
**2013-05-26T17:46:26+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Those tablets that will be just as powerful will also be just as expensive and without a complete overlap in features or software.  
**2013-05-26T17:46:29+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** And that´s why Xbox One will not be successful, SuperCell would not have had the resources to join that platform at launch. Indie developers will be key to capture the market.  
**2013-05-26T17:47:11+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** hydr: And Microsoft isn't exactly courting the indies at the moment.  
**2013-05-26T17:47:24+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** They never were  
**2013-05-26T17:47:55+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Sony are more welcoming with the PS4, but not nearly enough.  
**2013-05-26T17:48:04+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** they are all fleeing to Sony, of all places  
**2013-05-26T17:48:15+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** This is where Android/IOS has it´s benefits, it allows anyone to have a shot.  
**2013-05-26T17:48:23+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and are all still considering dumping conolse for iOS & Android  
**2013-05-26T17:48:35+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It is also worth noting that Sony have dipped their toys intot he waters of quasi-yearly hardware updates witht he PSP (as withthe iPad)  
**2013-05-26T17:49:26+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Blue is the Warmest Color won the Palm d'Or. Inside Llewyn Davis took Grand Prix.  
**2013-05-26T17:50:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Bruce Dern took Actor, of all things. big surprise, but welcome  
**2013-05-26T17:50:27+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** is hardcore gaming dying?  
**2013-05-26T17:50:36+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** yes  
**2013-05-26T17:50:42+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** agreed  
**2013-05-26T17:50:50+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the rate of attrition is higher than new adoption  
**2013-05-26T17:50:55+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** by far  
**2013-05-26T17:51:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** mainstream gaming has changed to mean Angry Birds  
**2013-05-26T17:51:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Which makes me sad with folks like BioWare finally figuring out how to tell a long-story compellingly in the medium.  
**2013-05-26T17:52:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** !s Overserving  
**2013-05-26T17:52:57+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** moiseschiu: I don't know about that. Prior to cycle of CoD/Battlefield megahits, the most successful PC game was The Sims. Seems like something of a fluke to me.  
**2013-05-26T17:53:23+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** theTiger: Finally? Baldur's Gate?  
**2013-05-26T17:53:38+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** phones are destroying console gaming. look at how many development houses have closed in the last 3 months, let alone year  
**2013-05-26T17:53:53+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** both sony and microsoft can try all they want, but in the end they´ll end up fighting over the "hardcore" gamer.  
**2013-05-26T17:54:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** quiesce: I meant more broadly as an industry.  
**2013-05-26T17:54:35+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** !s Way of the Future  
**2013-05-26T17:55:09+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** and that will be a very low % marketshare compared to mainstream gaming, which will be driven by indie developers  
**2013-05-26T17:55:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** hydr: yup. they're ignoring a massively larger pool of potential new users  
**2013-05-26T17:55:41+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** and easy access, mobility, and most of all more gaming for less.  
**2013-05-26T17:56:32+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** they think they can add a feature or two in order to win over "the masses" - it won´t work.  
**2013-05-26T17:57:18+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I can see Google TV having some sort of success when they get serious with gaming now.  
**2013-05-26T17:57:19+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Mobility aside, XBO and PS4 development could exhibit all of those traits.  
**2013-05-26T17:58:44+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** hydr: Google TV has the Android problem of no hardware standard and unpredictable updates.  
**2013-05-26T17:59:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** ~s Staying Foolish  
**2013-05-26T17:59:42+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Android got a whole lot of problems to deal with.  
**2013-05-26T18:00:10+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** But someone need to bring mainstream gaming to the living room soon.  
**2013-05-26T18:00:33+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** and with mainstream, I mean buying games for $3.99 instead of $49.99  
**2013-05-26T18:00:35+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Sony have Playstation Suite even if they don't seem as committed as they could/should be.  
**2013-05-26T18:01:37+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** and I´m pretty sure this is why TV is an "area of intense interest" for Apple, and also why they have not opened up third-party access to Apple TV.  
**2013-05-26T18:02:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I really hope not. I want something better for the Apple TV than a bunch of games.  
**2013-05-26T18:03:39+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Of course, it´s just one of many reasons to get it.  
**2013-05-26T18:03:55+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** UltraHD and h265 streaming would be another, and both of those are just about ready for mainstream.  
**2013-05-26T18:14:17+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Those are essentially refinements of existing features. I want a catalogue of third-party apps-as-channels (the sole reason I bought a Google TV) and perhaps more interaction with other devices. If anything, what you call mainstream gaming is becoming too ubiquitous to much matter.  
**2013-05-26T18:14:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Having/being a DVD video player was a selling feature for the PS2, and shortly after no one cared.
