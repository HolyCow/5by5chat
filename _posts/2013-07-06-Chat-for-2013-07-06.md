**2013-07-06T02:06:22+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** about to go live  
**2013-07-06T02:17:46+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Screen Time with @moiseschiu is starting now - http://t.co/MErWLdtI4S (52 seconds ago)  
**2013-07-06T02:23:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I was terribly disappointed that the Boxee never really did local playback as kilelr  
**2013-07-06T02:24:34+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** that was probably opposite to their vision though  
**2013-07-06T02:24:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** [narcan] yes, but because of where it came from that was the promise  
**2013-07-06T02:25:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** it would be the box that didn't need any work to be good at that  
**2013-07-06T02:25:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** XBMC is killer at that, and all of the other connected devices are terrible at local playback  
**2013-07-06T02:25:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** especially at that time  
**2013-07-06T02:25:45+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah, i think local playback was there just due because they did get it for free esentially  
**2013-07-06T02:26:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** yup. But even Boxee software for the computer was pretty good at it  
**2013-07-06T02:26:06+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** i dont think they'd be any better off honestly if they did focus on local playback  
**2013-07-06T02:26:09+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** they just never did work on that stuff for their hardware  
**2013-07-06T02:26:10+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** it's a shrinking market  
**2013-07-06T02:26:16+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** but running Boxee on your computer worked great for that  
**2013-07-06T02:26:24+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** so the fact that they box was already worse than what was just on my PC  
**2013-07-06T02:26:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** annoyed the hell out of me  
**2013-07-06T02:27:00+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah well your PC does have a pretty big hardware advantage  
**2013-07-06T02:27:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** the boxee never got much better as hardware versus netflix  
**2013-07-06T02:27:32+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** it didnt really need great hardware to do it's core features, playing internet video, which is all h264  
**2013-07-06T02:28:01+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** once you start trying to decode 720p MKV in CPU it obviously has issues  
**2013-07-06T02:28:35+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** in terms of the product, they probably would have been better off to just kill local playback  
**2013-07-06T02:28:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Yeah. Again, that just to me is the shame. For what they charged and what people who loved the software was using it for  
**2013-07-06T02:28:58+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** and promote what was core to it, internet video etc , but think it was just too much for them to bite off in the end  
**2013-07-06T02:29:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** that was a no-brainer  
**2013-07-06T02:29:08+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** That's the differentiated for double the price  
**2013-07-06T02:29:22+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah that was half the problem, a lot of their users came from XBMC  
**2013-07-06T02:29:38+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** not even. Their own software ran on computers  
**2013-07-06T02:29:39+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** so had high expectations in what they wanted from a machine like that  
**2013-07-06T02:29:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** before they released hardware  
**2013-07-06T02:29:47+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yep i know  
**2013-07-06T02:29:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** their hardware version did less than their software that was out for years  
**2013-07-06T02:30:33+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** !s Crazy or a Tinkerer  
**2013-07-06T02:31:24+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** i think it's tough for companies in the space though  
**2013-07-06T02:31:38+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I don't think its a necessary feature anymore  
**2013-07-06T02:31:41+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** but at the time it was  
**2013-07-06T02:31:55+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** it's*  
**2013-07-06T02:32:20+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah, i think it was confused from that POV, they didnt do a good enough job of selling people on what their vision was  
**2013-07-06T02:32:45+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** cause most people (me included) would have just looked at it as a machine to try and replace my htpc  
**2013-07-06T02:32:49+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** The breadth and quality of content streaming now makes it work better. But at the time the market was people who had a mix of local files and streaming. And their customers loved the local playback + streaming in a good interface with less tinkering than XBMC  
**2013-07-06T02:33:00+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** which i dont think ultimately it was meant to be that  
**2013-07-06T02:33:02+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah  
**2013-07-06T02:33:14+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** [narcan] that was all it was for me.. give me an appliance with appliance benefits to do what an HTPC does  
**2013-07-06T02:33:25+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** that's still what those boxes are to me in a lot of ways.  
**2013-07-06T02:33:29+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** think that would have driven the boxee box price up to try and have enough CPU in there  
**2013-07-06T02:33:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I find it hard to believe that their hardware at twice the price of their competitors that had everythign they did but nice software  
**2013-07-06T02:33:53+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** !current  
**2013-07-06T02:34:19+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** they couldn't pay for the power. I think it supported MKV out of the box as long as it was a wrapper around h264 which most of it was  
**2013-07-06T02:34:39+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah  
**2013-07-06T02:36:32+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** i do think Apple is on the right track with their approach though  
**2013-07-06T02:36:38+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** !s Avner Ronen on a Thrown of Gold  
**2013-07-06T02:36:50+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** !s Begging for a Review Unit  
**2013-07-06T02:37:22+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** supporting a bunch of imporant services on the box itself and keeping it simple and rock soild  
**2013-07-06T02:37:36+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** and then supporting everything else via Airplay (so to play things such as MKV etc)  
**2013-07-06T02:38:12+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** i'm able to do everything and more these days with the Apple TV + iPhone combo that most of my htpc's ever delivered  
**2013-07-06T02:38:29+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I prefer the Roku personally  
**2013-07-06T02:38:45+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** but I think that things are way better now  
**2013-07-06T02:41:10+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah i'm in Australia so Roku i dont think is very well supported here  
**2013-07-06T02:41:46+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** here we have way more than Apple stuff  
**2013-07-06T02:41:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** HBO Go first, sports first, Amazon video  
**2013-07-06T02:42:00+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** etc  
**2013-07-06T02:42:40+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** It's faster with better and more channels, just doesn't support iTunes (which I don't use) and AirPlay  
**2013-07-06T02:42:44+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** but has a native plex app  
**2013-07-06T02:43:19+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** apple tv has HBO go now, but yeah imagine there are more options if you need em  
**2013-07-06T02:43:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Roku has had it for a long time though that's what i mean  
**2013-07-06T02:43:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** years  
**2013-07-06T02:43:49+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** and i just used video stream to airplay mkv's from the PC  
**2013-07-06T02:45:12+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** is hbo go worth trying to hunt down ?  
**2013-07-06T02:45:27+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** way better movies and the great original programming  
**2013-07-06T02:45:28+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I think so  
**2013-07-06T02:45:49+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** looks like the easiest way is paying someone to share a password ?  
**2013-07-06T02:46:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** probably  
**2013-07-06T02:46:09+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** as obviously HBO wont connect me here in aus heh  
**2013-07-06T02:46:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** VPN  
**2013-07-06T02:46:23+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** though i did consider renting a house in detroit or something  
**2013-07-06T02:46:30+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** and getting them to connect me there  
**2013-07-06T02:46:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** you can buy a house in Detroit for 10k  
**2013-07-06T02:46:47+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** hah exactly  
**2013-07-06T02:47:03+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** then i can double my money by sharing out HBO subscriptions  
**2013-07-06T02:47:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** houses there cost less than the cost of demolition  
**2013-07-06T02:47:28+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** VPN sucks a bit for avoiding the geo blocks  
**2013-07-06T02:47:42+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** we use unblock.us here, which seems to fake things via DNS  
**2013-07-06T02:47:54+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** the details of I'm not exactly sure, but means you end up with a direct connection  
**2013-07-06T02:48:42+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** www.unblock-us.com sorry  
**2013-07-06T02:51:03+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** !s Fight for the User  
**2013-07-06T02:51:54+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** reminds me of the OUYA  
**2013-07-06T02:51:55+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** friends had to restart the Boxee Box too constnatly  
**2013-07-06T02:52:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** sounds like a deep software issue  
**2013-07-06T02:52:07+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** that thing's UI is also pretty terrible  
**2013-07-06T02:52:18+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** a mouse pointer just appears now and then for no reason  
**2013-07-06T02:52:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** ugh  
**2013-07-06T02:52:48+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** very slow, crashes , the control lag is *terrible* on some games  
**2013-07-06T02:53:03+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** but heard good things about just using emulators on it, so think i'll do that this weekend  
**2013-07-06T02:53:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** yeah  
**2013-07-06T02:53:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** you know as much as emulation is iffy… I'd pay 99 for an SNES/N64 emulator alone  
**2013-07-06T02:53:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** that plus Roku = HTPC 98%  
**2013-07-06T02:54:52+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** ha yeah, be pretty awesome to have a really focused SNES emulator machine  
**2013-07-06T02:55:06+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** that came with replications and / or support for original controllers  
**2013-07-06T02:55:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** yup  
**2013-07-06T02:55:24+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** something like that that would melt down kickstarter  
**2013-07-06T02:55:31+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** but i'd imagine there's a legal hicup somewhere in there  
**2013-07-06T02:55:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** big time  
**2013-07-06T02:56:41+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** shit, nintendo should do it hah  
**2013-07-06T02:57:03+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** might be a better bet that what they've currently got going on  
**2013-07-06T02:57:12+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** thats what they think virtual console is  
**2013-07-06T02:57:31+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** yeah  
**2013-07-06T02:58:39+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** i just want something that returns to the simplicity of playing a game  
**2013-07-06T02:59:00+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** plug one cord into the power, one into the tv, and one controller hanging off the machine, and a game loads in 1 second  
**2013-07-06T02:59:06+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** the wii u has too much going on  
**2013-07-06T02:59:21+00:00** - **&lt;[narcan]&gt;** have ot remember to keep too many things charged, too many menus etc  
**2013-07-06T03:06:51+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** [narcan] i agree. I play games on my mac mini using emulation  
**2013-07-06T03:06:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** becuase the experience sucks  
**2013-07-06T03:07:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** so i use an XBox360  
**2013-07-06T03:07:06+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** remote  
**2013-07-06T03:07:08+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** and a macmini  
**2013-07-06T03:08:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Philips had a full time employee for their quad-color tvs

**2013-07-06T03:45:30+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I think "Fingers in Many Pies" will become this show's "Siracusa County"
