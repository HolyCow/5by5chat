**2013-02-08 01:06:35 +0000** - **jbecker:** 30" now for my area  
**2013-02-08 01:06:36 +0000** - **jbecker:** yikes  
**2013-02-08 03:33:31 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** alright spaceteam. I have discovered and confirmed without a shadow of a doubt that AT&T blocks irc in ATL on 4G and LTE  
**2013-02-08 03:33:50 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** my question now  
**2013-02-08 03:34:13 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** what VPN solutions can I switch to (I already pay for a VPN that work subsidizes for travel) which work well on iPhone  
**2013-02-08 03:34:33 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** please tweet me if you read this at @afwaller or adn at @afwaller or gmail at afwaller@gmail.com  
**2013-02-08 03:35:12 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** or just in general does anyone have experience with VPN on iPhone  
**2013-02-08 03:35:48 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** in general I have followed the tolkien path on this one  
**2013-02-08 03:36:20 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** do not meddle in the affairs of iOS VPN/Proxy, for such settings are subtle and quick to anger  
**2013-02-08 03:37:30 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** but I want to use my iPad and iPhone for chatroom instead of my macbook air, because sometimes there isn&apos;t wifi, and let&apos;s be honest macbook air is more like macbook brick compared to an iPad mini  
**2013-02-08 03:37:55 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** so. Please let me know if you have experience in the affairs of wizards. and meddling thereof.  
**2013-02-08 03:38:05 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** therein, perhaps  
**2013-02-08 03:38:15 +0000** - **afwaller_remote:** thank you, that will be all.
