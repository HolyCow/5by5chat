**2013-06-16T01:20:19+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The Web Ahead 53 with @jensimmons - http://t.co/hTISAiYHCM (56 seconds ago)  
**2013-06-16T01:28:27+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** Hmm that Nessie mic is $100 and so is the Yeti. I wonder how they compare  
**2013-06-16T02:14:53+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** is there even a good IRC client for iPad  
**2013-06-16T02:58:55+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** torchie: I just use prompt to ssh into a lunix server I'm running screeen+irssi  on.  
**2013-06-16T02:59:11+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** baaaah  
**2013-06-16T02:59:23+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** it works ok  
**2013-06-16T02:59:25+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** i've been VNCing into my mac running textual  
**2013-06-16T02:59:47+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** just got one called palaver that seems like it'll be pretty good but then i realized how much bouncers cost  
**2013-06-16T03:00:17+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** maybe one day when I get a real home internet connection I'll just run znc from home  
**2013-06-16T03:00:26+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** i haven't tried colloquy on ios but on mac it's crap  
**2013-06-16T03:02:08+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** such hate  
**2013-06-16T03:02:24+00:00** - **&lt;torchie&gt;** i liked colloquy but it had a couple of odd UI quirks that made me eventually get textual  
**2013-06-16T03:09:34+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** I'll try textual the next time I think I need an irc client on the mac  
**2013-06-16T03:13:20+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** but it's not hate it's just that I disagree with every UI decision colloquy has made.  
**2013-06-16T09:02:53+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce``&gt;** Poor Colloquy. So unloved.  
**2013-06-16T15:46:32+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker&gt;** Vlot I like textual. I used Colloquy  
**2013-06-16T16:12:06+00:00** - **&lt;guest12345678&gt;** no asymco today?  
**2013-06-16T16:14:46+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I haven't heard anything, unfortunately
