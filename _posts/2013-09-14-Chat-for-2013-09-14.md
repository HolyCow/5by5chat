**2013-09-14T00:35:45+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** heyoh  
**2013-09-14T00:36:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Evenin'  
**2013-09-14T00:41:32+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** anyone have any suggestions for learning how to write an irc bot?  
**2013-09-14T00:42:16+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** not for evil, but for good  
**2013-09-14T00:42:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Not a bit. :)  
**2013-09-14T00:43:43+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** bummer. I want to know how dan (or whomever) wrote the script to update the topic  
**2013-09-14T00:44:52+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh. You'll might be amused to know that that's done by a human.  
**2013-09-14T00:45:16+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** KimRoen has an IFTTT that watches the 5by5 calendar and emails him when it changes.  
**2013-09-14T00:45:29+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** He'll come in and update the topic.  
**2013-09-14T00:45:41+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** You might be**  
**2013-09-14T00:45:45+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** are you kidding?  
**2013-09-14T00:45:54+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I really can write. My fingers just don't let me. :)  
**2013-09-14T00:45:57+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I am not.  
**2013-09-14T00:46:08+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Haddie does it some time as well, but it's usually Kim.  
**2013-09-14T00:46:18+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** He's one of the channel ops for this place.  
**2013-09-14T00:46:19+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** Ha. That's strange  
**2013-09-14T00:46:37+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** As far as I understand it, you can use colloquy to run applescripts  
**2013-09-14T00:46:52+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** so they could just be doing this with a bot and IFTTT  
**2013-09-14T00:51:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Low priority I would guess.  
**2013-09-14T00:51:58+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** well, I'm adding it to my project list. maybe it'll be useful to others  
**2013-09-14T00:52:15+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** But kim just changes it every day?  
**2013-09-14T00:52:19+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** that's so nuts.  
**2013-09-14T00:52:55+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Every day... Usually several times.  
**2013-09-14T00:53:13+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** unsung heros  
**2013-09-14T00:53:30+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Indeed. He's one of mine. :)  
**2013-09-14T00:53:41+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** What is his twitter handle?  
**2013-09-14T00:53:53+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** @kimroen  
**2013-09-14T00:54:47+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Ah, but he comes to change the topic and I comment on it. That is sometimes something like half of my activity in here.  
**2013-09-14T00:54:55+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Why don't you want us to be friends?  
**2013-09-14T00:56:30+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** lol  
**2013-09-14T00:57:17+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme&gt;** I think Kim would probably ultimately save an aggregate 2 months of his life. you two could hike the himalayas!  
**2013-09-14T03:43:03+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** abolishme: cinch is a good ruby library for writing irc bots ... see Showbot  
**2013-09-14T03:46:14+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** or seenbot https://github.com/HolyCow/5by5seenbot  
**2013-09-14T03:46:33+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Showbot uses an older version of cinch so some things are slightly different

**2013-09-14T16:08:14+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** Anything happening today?  
**2013-09-14T16:08:23+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** nothing  
**2013-09-14T16:08:36+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** meh  
**2013-09-14T16:08:57+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** here neither  
**2013-09-14T16:09:14+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** my damn LFW ticket was incorrectly filled out so I'm stuck out of fashion week  
**2013-09-14T16:09:19+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** it's a royal pain in the ass  
**2013-09-14T16:09:55+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** so I figured I'll come into an Apple store and log into an IRC channel and see if I get any funny looks from the Apple people who probably don't work in a terminal at all  
**2013-09-14T16:10:00+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** Go go gadget emacs!

**2013-09-14T16:14:12+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** abolishme abolishme_ there are two of you  
**2013-09-14T16:14:29+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** which is the real abolishme? Fight for superiority!  
**2013-09-14T16:14:30+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** my client is still logged in at my office  
**2013-09-14T16:14:41+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** i'm in bed watching martha stuart  
**2013-09-14T16:14:44+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Haha  
**2013-09-14T16:15:04+00:00** - **&lt;throwaway&gt;** Beautiful way to spend a day  
**2013-09-14T16:15:12+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** It's a good thingâ„¢  
**2013-09-14T16:15:47+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** there being two of me?  
**2013-09-14T16:16:02+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** No, Martha Stewart says that a lot - I think it's her, I can't remember.  
**2013-09-14T16:22:13+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** she hasn't said it yet  
**2013-09-14T16:22:27+00:00** - **&lt;abolishme_&gt;** "look at all those lumps" is what she's said more than once
