**2013-07-18T00:18:40+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** stupid xchat  
**2013-07-18T00:18:44+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** need a better client than this  
**2013-07-18T00:19:28+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Sup Jackals?  
**2013-07-18T01:06:47+00:00** - **&lt;nickjones&gt;** Audio questionâ€¦ Does anyone in here have any experience with Presonus USB interfaces with Macs?  
**2013-07-18T03:53:54+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** TGIF  
**2013-07-18T11:09:08+00:00** - **&lt;BigPig&gt;** exit  
**2013-07-18T11:09:12+00:00** - **&lt;BigPig&gt;** bye  
**2013-07-18T14:11:01+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** How often does everybody update their apps?  I used to kill the red badge every time I saw it, but I've been slacking lately and finally updated 21 apps this morning.  
**2013-07-18T14:11:20+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** in what os  
**2013-07-18T14:11:41+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** On the phone, ios7 beta automatic updating is absolutely magical and awesome  
**2013-07-18T14:12:20+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** It's like a present almost every morning. There's a notification that so-and-so has updated and I get to go check the release notes to see if there's new features  
**2013-07-18T14:27:45+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** truemarmalade I can't wait for that, my apps are always needing to be updated  
**2013-07-18T14:30:13+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Luckily I've never had the problem of a developer releasing an update that breaks the app, but I can understand the concern over that  
**2013-07-18T14:30:24+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** It's easy to turn off the automatic updating though.  
**2013-07-18T14:34:02+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** I want automatic updating of Vim plugins  
**2013-07-18T14:35:04+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** If I knew what that was, I'm sure I could empathize  
**2013-07-18T14:35:39+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** or sympathize. I can't ever remember which is correct.  
**2013-07-18T14:40:30+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** probably both =P  
**2013-07-18T14:45:01+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** any news on the schedule for B2W?  
**2013-07-18T14:52:31+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** tjbarber: Have you seen Pathogen?  
**2013-07-18T14:53:31+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** creature yeah I'm using Pathogen  
**2013-07-18T14:53:35+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** does it auto-update  
**2013-07-18T14:54:00+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** Not auto-update, but most plugins end up as git clones.  
**2013-07-18T14:54:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Did they not get to finish recording yesterday's episode, ChrisLTD?  
**2013-07-18T14:54:46+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** creature yeah that's what it's doing. It's great, but I have to manually go in and pull the updates ;P  
**2013-07-18T14:55:13+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** Sounds like something you could automate with a cronjob pretty easily. :)  
**2013-07-18T14:56:39+00:00** - **&lt;tjbarber&gt;** creature yeah, true. Should have thought about that.  
**2013-07-18T14:56:40+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** theTiger: did they record one yesterday?  
**2013-07-18T14:56:47+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** theTiger: tuesday's episode was aborted  
**2013-07-18T14:57:09+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** ChrisLTD: they started, merlin had computer/audio problems, dan said they were going to try again later, but never did  
**2013-07-18T14:57:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Was it Tuesday? Whichever day. Things are beginning to run together for me this week. I've been out of the office sic.  
**2013-07-18T14:57:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** sick**  
**2013-07-18T14:57:32+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** ok  
**2013-07-18T14:59:08+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** truemarmalade: iOS 6  
**2013-07-18T14:59:42+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Delayed response  
**2013-07-18T14:59:51+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I am async  
**2013-07-18T15:00:00+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** But yeah, I know those feels  
**2013-07-18T15:00:03+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Or knew, rather  
**2013-07-18T15:01:16+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I would probably use auto update.  But I look through the updates and more often than not they say "bugfixes and optimizations" without saying what those entail, so I'll skip if I'm not having problems.  
**2013-07-18T15:01:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I just obsessively update my apps always.  
**2013-07-18T15:02:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Post-PC Traumatic Stress Disorder, I'm sure.  
**2013-07-18T15:36:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** So, a 30" Cinema Display happened to make its way onto my desk...  
**2013-07-18T15:36:21+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm not sure that I want to ever give it up. >.>  
**2013-07-18T15:36:31+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** strange how something that large could just, suddenly appear out of nowhere  
**2013-07-18T15:37:42+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** They had to steal my adapter for the Acer screen I usually have, so I pulled the spare display in the office. Which just happened to be. . .  
**2013-07-18T15:38:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Our internal pixel-pusher just left for greener pastures and we've not hired his replacement yet.  
**2013-07-18T15:38:45+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** I push pixels all day and love my thunderbolt display for viewing page layouts at 100%  
**2013-07-18T15:39:33+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Just having the resolution match my iMac is worth the lost desk space. :D  
**2013-07-18T15:43:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Though, sitting this close to it makes it seem like I'm being irradiated.  
**2013-07-18T15:54:05+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** I love the 27" Thunderbolt on my desk at the main office, especially coupled with a 15" retina MBP and a 24" Viewsonic third screen  
**2013-07-18T15:54:11+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** use all the desktop space  
**2013-07-18T15:54:26+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I would find ways to use all of the desktop space. :D  
**2013-07-18T15:55:06+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** The one annoying thing about this whole set-up is the fact that our POS system anchors itself to the top left of the primary screen and refuses to be moved.  
**2013-07-18T15:55:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** So, I'm constantly having to work around it. >.>  
**2013-07-18T16:12:11+00:00** - **&lt;TJLuoma&gt;** Did they actually record a BackToWork this week?  
**2013-07-18T16:14:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** They attempted to.  
**2013-07-18T16:15:09+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Consensus is that they were not able to finish and have not tried again yet.  
**2013-07-18T16:56:37+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The News 107 with @imyke - http://t.co/WZfzY4ARBJ (6 seconds ago)  
**2013-07-18T17:01:54+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** We could make up a B2W episode.  
**2013-07-18T17:02:35+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** "Did you know there are literally more germs in a bathroom than at the bottom of a dumpster?  I would rather lick a trash can than touch the handle of a bathroom door."  
**2013-07-18T17:02:57+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Those two are crazy about that stuff  
**2013-07-18T17:03:04+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Like, what do you think an immune system is for  
**2013-07-18T17:03:40+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** They are so sanitary they have none.  
**2013-07-18T17:03:59+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Exactly. I think a lifetime of not washing my hands has built up mine that I never get sick  
**2013-07-18T17:04:06+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Because I literally never get sick  
**2013-07-18T17:04:35+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** For me it is maybe once a year.  
**2013-07-18T17:05:16+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** and Dan almost died last month  
**2013-07-18T17:05:30+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** I bet if he had been eating his boogers for the last 30 years he'd be invincible  
**2013-07-18T17:08:06+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Everybody actually eats their boogers already. We swallow about a quart of mucus a day.  
**2013-07-18T17:08:08+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** !neckbeard  
**2013-07-18T17:08:09+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** Erm, so.  
**2013-07-18T17:11:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yum  
**2013-07-18T17:29:11+00:00** - **&lt;Rory&gt;** Could someone tell me if there was a Back 2 Work this week?  
**2013-07-18T17:29:26+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** I swear I'm going to set up a text expander shortcut to explain this  
**2013-07-18T17:29:34+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman_&gt;** :-)  
**2013-07-18T17:29:52+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** They tried, merlin had audio / computer problems, they were going to try again later in the day, but didn't.  
**2013-07-18T17:29:56+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Rory: There wasn't.  
**2013-07-18T17:30:03+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** So much typing. I may have to nap.  
**2013-07-18T17:32:07+00:00** - **&lt;Rory&gt;** truemarmalade thanks  
**2013-07-18T18:48:55+00:00** - **&lt;nerddotis&gt;** Any news on Tuesday's B2W being posted?  
**2013-07-18T18:49:05+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** It didn't happen  
**2013-07-18T18:49:19+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** They tried, merlin had audio / computer problems about 20 min in, they were going to try again later in the day, but didn't.  
**2013-07-18T18:50:02+00:00** - **&lt;nerddotis&gt;** Thanks. My imagination was running wild. I should have come here two days ago.  
**2013-07-18T18:57:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh, at this point, we should have Kim put a note up in the topic. :D  
**2013-07-18T18:58:17+00:00** - **&lt;nerddotis&gt;** Probably. I literally bought an IRC client app just to login and ask the question.  
**2013-07-18T18:58:52+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** I wonder how many @'s dan's getting on twitter about it  
**2013-07-18T18:59:53+00:00** - **&lt;nerddotis&gt;** I searched #B2W and didn't see much. Then I realized the chat would have all the answers.  
**2013-07-18T19:00:07+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Indeed the chat does  
**2013-07-18T19:00:14+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Jackals are ON IT.  
**2013-07-18T19:02:08+00:00** - **&lt;nerddotis&gt;** I should have joined the pack years ago  
**2013-07-18T19:05:40+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Apropos of nothing, the album I'm listening to has background sounds that are identical to TweetBot's notification noise. I keep looking over to TweetBot and being disappointed. :(  
**2013-07-18T19:06:04+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Kinda like when haddie forgets to silence her phone  
**2013-07-18T19:06:07+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** or mac, or whatever  
**2013-07-18T19:06:16+00:00** - *theTiger nods.*  
**2013-07-18T19:41:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Ting.  
**2013-07-18T19:41:57+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Is the noise you just made limechat make  
**2013-07-18T19:43:34+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Hey quiesce. Haven't seen ya in a while? How's you? :)  
**2013-07-18T20:45:31+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** anyone know what happened to b2w 128 from tuesday?  
**2013-07-18T20:46:35+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** yes  
**2013-07-18T20:46:56+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** what?  
**2013-07-18T20:47:46+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** didn't happen because of technical problems on merlin's side  
**2013-07-18T20:47:55+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** ok, thanks!  
**2013-07-18T20:47:57+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** that's too bad  
**2013-07-18T20:48:12+00:00** - **&lt;Vlot&gt;** they tried for a while but didn't get it to work  
**2013-07-18T20:48:12+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** i'm going to assume technical problems means lots of comics came out that day  
**2013-07-18T20:48:24+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Eh, no  
**2013-07-18T20:48:30+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** They did 20 minutes of show, then merlin just dropped  
**2013-07-18T20:48:42+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** i was just joking.  oh well.  
**2013-07-18T20:49:01+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** However! It might have been on purpose due to lots of comics coming out that day  
**2013-07-18T20:49:16+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** keep an eye on the tumblr  
**2013-07-18T20:49:24+00:00** - **&lt;franque&gt;** thanks for the info.  see yous jackals later.  
**2013-07-18T21:00:12+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** theTiger: so-so  
**2013-07-18T21:03:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** quiesce: Heh, I know that feeling well. :)  
**2013-07-18T21:14:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** In Frequency-Banter-esque news, Jay-Z is now to be known as Jay Z.  
**2013-07-18T21:15:25+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://rapfix.mtv.com/2013/07/18/jay-z-officially-drops-hyphen-to-become-jay-z/  
**2013-07-18T21:22:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** So we call him J-Zee now, got it.  
**2013-07-18T21:35:43+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Onward to the beer release party...  
**2013-07-18T21:35:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Bye Jackals. :D  
**2013-07-18T22:02:36+00:00** - **&lt;mdclark01&gt;** a
