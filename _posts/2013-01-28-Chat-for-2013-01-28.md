**2013-01-28 14:54:08 +0000** - **theTiger:** Good morning Jackals. :)  
**2013-01-28 15:05:22 +0000** - **haroldina:** &apos;morning theTiger  
**2013-01-28 15:12:04 +0000** - **uv:** not starting on time! If this was boot camp you would have needed to make the show longer to make up for it...  
**2013-01-28 15:14:03 +0000** - **haroldina:** If that were the case, they&apos;d still be doing Thursday&apos;s show.  
**2013-01-28 15:15:05 +0000** - **uv:** Well, sometimes you lose your weekend pass.  
**2013-01-28 15:18:29 +0000** - **haroldina:** Can you imagine who Dan and the sound board would sound after 4 days straight?  
**2013-01-28 15:18:43 +0000** - **haroldina:** They&apos;d just be giggling back and forth at each other.  
**2013-01-28 15:19:56 +0000** - **prehnRA:** i imagine dan would become something like colonel kurtz after 4 straight days of broadcasting  
**2013-01-28 15:20:40 +0000** - **haroldina:** "All work and no play makes Dan a dull boy"  
**2013-01-28 15:40:13 +0000** - **haroldina:** I have to go outside now, so I&apos;m guessing the show will start in 30 seconds.  
**2013-01-28 15:48:20 +0000** - **haroldina:** It&apos;s looking like they&apos;re recording after the Crossover today  
**2013-01-28 15:50:20 +0000** - **scottnelle:** I&apos;m gonna do a short podcast and start it at 10 AM EST because its the one time that I&apos;m guaranteed to never be conflicting with a 5by5 show ;-)  
**2013-01-28 15:50:28 +0000** - **mvm92:** :P  
**2013-01-28 15:55:33 +0000** - **danbenjamin:** INSERT COIN

**2013-01-28 15:57:42 +0000** - **theTiger:** The ever-inscrutable Dan Benjamin

**2013-01-28 15:57:55 +0000** - **danbenjamin:** A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.

**2013-01-28 15:58:06 +0000** - **mvm92:** start select  
**2013-01-28 15:58:18 +0000** - **krger:** danbenjamin: What is "the lottery?"  
**2013-01-28 15:58:40 +0000** - **haroldina:** Suck it, Trebek  
**2013-01-28 16:02:13 +0000** - **mvm92:** smooth  
**2013-01-28 16:02:40 +0000** - **theTiger:** HOORAY!  
**2013-01-28 16:02:53 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** so short frequency, then crossover?  
**2013-01-28 16:03:02 +0000** - **danbenjamin:** nope  
**2013-01-28 16:03:08 +0000** - **showbot:** [@5by5](http://twitter.com/5by5): The Frequency with [@haddiebird](http://twitter.com/haddiebird) &amp; [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin) is starting now - [http://t.co/sI19cI8S](http://t.co/sI19cI8S) (49 seconds ago)

**2013-01-28 16:07:45 +0000** - **duckbar:** Is this what people tune in for?

**2013-01-28 16:12:14 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** before the movie I saw on Saturday  
**2013-01-28 16:12:21 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** there was an extended behind-the-scenes Surface commercial  
**2013-01-28 16:12:26 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** with like... the dance choreographer  
**2013-01-28 16:12:28 +0000** - **theTiger:** Never as excited in the intro as on the show. :)  
**2013-01-28 16:12:29 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** it was really strange  
**2013-01-28 16:12:47 +0000** - **theTiger:** I&apos;d just make the intro more excited.  
**2013-01-28 16:12:48 +0000** - **haroldina:** UltraNurd: There was a choreographer?  
**2013-01-28 16:13:02 +0000** - **haroldina:** I assumed it was all spontaneous.  
**2013-01-28 16:13:18 +0000** - **haroldina:** My world is crumbling.  
**2013-01-28 16:13:19 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** haroldina: he talks about the tactility of the "click" or something artsy  
**2013-01-28 16:13:32 +0000** - **haroldina:** worst commercial ever  
**2013-01-28 16:13:53 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** !l [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk-F8jmgrlo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk-F8jmgrlo)

**2013-01-28 16:14:05 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** during the pre-trailers trailers  
**2013-01-28 16:14:13 +0000** - **OldBailey:** The Haddie sound clips just scream for abuse. Dan - "So, are you wearing your I Heart Windows 3.1 sweatshirt?" CLICK, "Oh, It&apos;s ON."  
**2013-01-28 16:14:46 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** haroldina: oddly, their &apos;90s nostalgia commercial is amazing

**2013-01-28 16:15:36 +0000** - **OldBailey:** "Contherocy"  
**2013-01-28 16:16:06 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** in theory, we&apos;re protected from illegal search and seizure - but the NSA has played semantics to say that it&apos;s not an "intercept" until a human looks at the collected data

**2013-01-28 16:29:53 +0000** - **haroldina:** heh  
**2013-01-28 16:30:02 +0000** - **haroldina:** Spell check didn&apos;t even underline it for me.

**2013-01-28 16:31:54 +0000** - **haroldina:** 9 times?

**2013-01-28 16:33:10 +0000** - **haroldina:** !s A Black Art  
**2013-01-28 16:33:30 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** most of the remaining compressible stuff relies on human perceptual studies, no?  
**2013-01-28 16:33:42 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** like figuring out what we can&apos;t perceive easily, and getting rid of it  
**2013-01-28 16:33:46 +0000** - **haroldina:** !s I Would Stand In It  
**2013-01-28 16:33:48 +0000** - **OldBailey:** Have they promised not to charge for h.265 for free video like they did for h.264  
**2013-01-28 16:33:54 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** whether it&apos;s in color space or time or whatever  
**2013-01-28 16:34:12 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** oldbailey: the first article about h.265 I read mentioned patent entanglements  
**2013-01-28 16:34:26 +0000** - **haroldina:** People, YOLO stands for You Obviously Like Owls  
**2013-01-28 16:34:45 +0000** - **theTiger:** My trivia guy did not accept that answer. :(  
**2013-01-28 16:34:46 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** I got into a Twitter discussion about how to translate YOLO into Elvish...  
**2013-01-28 16:35:11 +0000** - *theTiger coughs &apos;nerd&apos;.*

**2013-01-28 16:37:53 +0000** - **haroldina:** I&apos;d say telling him he should be happy for the exposure is admitting they did it.  
**2013-01-28 16:38:28 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** this is really amusing live with Paul & Storm doing the backing vocals  
**2013-01-28 16:38:44 +0000** - **OldBailey:** link to the song in iTunes: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/baby-got-back/id192510434?i=192510502](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/baby-got-back/id192510434?i=192510502)  
**2013-01-28 16:38:47 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i love joco. but ya know, what he did was an arrangement. the only thing he authored in the song was his name he inserted.  
**2013-01-28 16:39:00 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** what I think is interesting is that JoCo is high enough profile that a number of other indie musicians have mentioned that Glee has ripped off their covers  
**2013-01-28 16:39:07 +0000** - **theTiger:** !l [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/baby-got-back-in-style-glee/id596893770?i=596893791](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/baby-got-back-in-style-glee/id596893770?i=596893791)  
**2013-01-28 16:39:16 +0000** - **haroldina:** crucialwax: He authored the music  
**2013-01-28 16:39:17 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** crucialwax: it&apos;s probably not illegal, but it is unethical, I think  
**2013-01-28 16:39:19 +0000** - **mbaxa:** the music track was all his  
**2013-01-28 16:39:31 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** it&apos;s not clear if Glee used his actual recordings. I think maybe they did  
**2013-01-28 16:39:41 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** they&apos;ll never admit it though  
**2013-01-28 16:39:47 +0000** - **crucialwax:** haroldina, that&apos;s an arrangement though.  
**2013-01-28 16:40:05 +0000** - **haroldina:** Right, but the way you said it makes it sound like it was a straight cover.  
**2013-01-28 16:40:15 +0000** - **OldBailey:** theTiger&apos;s link is better than mine - it goes to the Glee specific version  
**2013-01-28 16:40:28 +0000** - **haroldina:** Whether or not he has legal standing, it&apos;s still a shitting thing for Fox to do.  
**2013-01-28 16:41:01 +0000** - **crucialwax:** the author was compensated. it&apos;s not like that didn&apos;t happen.  
**2013-01-28 16:41:02 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** I guess the reason why it&apos;s probably legal is that there&apos;s no such thing as a cover of a cover? the licensing just goes back to the original songwriter  
**2013-01-28 16:41:25 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** I tried Glee, but I wanted it to be more like a capella group than show choir  
**2013-01-28 16:41:48 +0000** - **haroldina:** I tried Glee, but all the characters were horrible people  
**2013-01-28 16:41:51 +0000** - **crucialwax:** an artist who does a cover can make an arrangement with the original author to get some ownership of his arrangement. joco didn&apos;t do that.  
**2013-01-28 16:41:52 +0000** - **jamuraa:** UltraNurd: Watched sing-off?  
**2013-01-28 16:42:03 +0000** - **jamuraa:** I didn&apos;t like the drama of Glee  
**2013-01-28 16:42:29 +0000** - **haroldina:** crucialwax: that&apos;s why people are focusing on the actual backing tracks  
**2013-01-28 16:43:01 +0000** - **crucialwax:** haroldina, not sure what you mean by actual backing tracks.  
**2013-01-28 16:43:10 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** jamuraa: nope. and yeah, it&apos;s that fake high school portrayal that my wife and I tired of  
**2013-01-28 16:43:11 +0000** - **haroldina:** The instrumental track.  
**2013-01-28 16:43:41 +0000** - **haroldina:** Tha banjo, the claps, the duck  
**2013-01-28 16:43:42 +0000** - **jamuraa:** UltraNurd: The Sing-off is a capella competition show, it&apos;s not too bad when it&apos;s on.  
**2013-01-28 16:43:52 +0000** - **crucialwax:** copyright doesn&apos;t work like that though haroldina. you copyright melody and lyrics. not arrangements.  
**2013-01-28 16:44:08 +0000** - **haroldina:** I think you&apos;ve missed some of the drama  
**2013-01-28 16:44:21 +0000** - **OldBailey:** what about the quack that coulton added - isn&apos;t that &apos;extraarrangemental&apos; ?  
**2013-01-28 16:44:28 +0000** - **haroldina:** There&apos;s some evidence that they lifted his recording for the backing track  
**2013-01-28 16:44:43 +0000** - **crucialwax:** where did coulton get that quack? pretty sure it&apos;s not his duck.  
**2013-01-28 16:44:45 +0000** - **haroldina:** And you can copyright an arrangement.  
**2013-01-28 16:44:50 +0000** - **haroldina:** wow, dude.  
**2013-01-28 16:44:55 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** the quack I think only matters if they used his actual audio, as opposed to just inserting a quack, right?  
**2013-01-28 16:45:03 +0000** - **crucialwax:** haroldina, only if you have an arrangement with the original author.  
**2013-01-28 16:45:08 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** I think this is an example where most people&apos;s intuition about copyright law runs into the actual law  
**2013-01-28 16:45:09 +0000** - **haroldina:** Oh, reset  
**2013-01-28 16:45:26 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i should say agreement instead. confusing to use the word arrangement in two contexts.  
**2013-01-28 16:45:28 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** it seems like JoCo did something unique in his version, and the big guy copied it for their benefit  
**2013-01-28 16:45:46 +0000** - **haroldina:** I&apos;m saying people are focusing on trying to determine if they&apos;re using his instrumental track by analyzing elements like the claps, the banjo and the quack.  
**2013-01-28 16:45:46 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** so that&apos;s why I say, legal, but unethical  
**2013-01-28 16:45:53 +0000** - **OldBailey:** UltraNurd: yeah, my understanding is that it would only be a problem if they lifted JC&apos;s audio of the quack. (&ast;Not a lawyer)  
**2013-01-28 16:45:55 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** (especially not to credit him, even if it&apos;s not required)  
**2013-01-28 16:45:58 +0000** - **crucialwax:** UltraNurd, if they sampled his quack, that might be an issue. but where did coulton get that quack? that would have to answered as well.,  
**2013-01-28 16:46:02 +0000** - **haroldina:** Because he doesn&apos;t have a copyright on the arrangement  
**2013-01-28 16:46:36 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** crucialwax: I don&apos;t think he addressed that in his posts. probably a stock sound library.  
**2013-01-28 16:46:52 +0000** - **haroldina:** He played and recorded the banjo track himself.  
**2013-01-28 16:47:03 +0000** - **haroldina:** That&apos;s not in a gray area  
**2013-01-28 16:47:20 +0000** - **crucialwax:** sure haroldina. and are you saying they sampled his banjo and used? they&apos;re free to play their own banjo.  
**2013-01-28 16:47:36 +0000** - **haroldina:** I don&apos;t think you&apos;re paying attention to what I&apos;m saying.  
**2013-01-28 16:47:45 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** as to why he didn&apos;t get some kind of pass-through arrangement license from Sir Mix-A-Lot, it&apos;s probably because he recorded this when he was first getting started, as part of Thing A Week  
**2013-01-28 16:47:45 +0000** - **haroldina:** People are trying to figure out if they did.  
**2013-01-28 16:48:04 +0000** - **crucialwax:** haroldina, so you think they&apos;re in the wrong without being certain what they did?  
**2013-01-28 16:48:10 +0000** - **haroldina:** sweet jesus  
**2013-01-28 16:48:30 +0000** - **crucialwax:** UltraNurd, yes, I think that&apos;s likely the case.  
**2013-01-28 16:48:49 +0000** - **haroldina:** I think they&apos;re in the wrong for using his arrangement without any credit, regardless of the legality of that.  
**2013-01-28 16:48:54 +0000** - **duckbar:** YLNT  
**2013-01-28 16:49:05 +0000** - **haroldina:** And other people are trying to determine if they did something illegal  
**2013-01-28 16:49:34 +0000** - **haroldina:** I have no standing to bring a suit against Fox, so I don&apos;t care if they did something illegal.  
**2013-01-28 16:49:38 +0000** - **haroldina:** They&apos;re still assholes.  
**2013-01-28 16:49:46 +0000** - **crucialwax:** haroldina, ok, i get that you think what they did is morally wrong. The legal issues are completely separate, and at this point, I&apos;ve seen no evidence they did something legally incorrect.  
**2013-01-28 16:50:08 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** probably we need to write a paper on the difference between ethics and morals again :D

**2013-01-28 16:50:47 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** which is common on youtube especially  
**2013-01-28 16:50:54 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** is the "no infringement intended" meme  
**2013-01-28 16:51:01 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** that is, people understand that you can&apos;t just copy and share stuff  
**2013-01-28 16:51:07 +0000** - **crucialwax:** UltraNurd, perhaps. :) But I also think joco is benefiting from this attention. It&apos;s not unlike the whole file sharing issue is probably a net benefit to the recording industry, and that has actual legal implications, where this doesn/t.  
**2013-01-28 16:51:11 +0000** - **UltraNurd:** but they think that if you say "I didn&apos;t mean it" and don&apos;t make money, it&apos;s okay  
**2013-01-28 16:51:19 +0000** - **mvm92:** I knew a guy who said, in total confidence "If it&apos;s on youtube, It&apos;s in the public domain"
