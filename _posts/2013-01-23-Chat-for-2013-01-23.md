**2013-01-23 16:14:08 +0000** - **byrnbaker:** Its your training, why take a chance  
**2013-01-23 16:14:22 +0000** - **byrnbaker:** makes sure they never get back up and try and hurt you I say  
**2013-01-23 16:15:09 +0000** - **badhedgehog:** !s Beijing Is Bladerunner  
**2013-01-23 16:15:18 +0000** - **jbecker:** badhedgehog: i was just finishing that up  
**2013-01-23 16:15:34 +0000** - **haroldina:** So that&apos;s what the 700s look like, huh?  
**2013-01-23 16:15:37 +0000** - **motohooligan:** !s This is going to freak you out  
**2013-01-23 16:15:48 +0000** - **jbecker:** God I love that soundtrack

**2013-01-23 16:16:09 +0000** - **motohooligan:** !s Sick and Tired of YouTube  
**2013-01-23 16:16:20 +0000** - **ZGruk:** !s Hear it Without Sound  
**2013-01-23 16:18:37 +0000** - **motohooligan:** !s I tested it out i swear  
**2013-01-23 16:18:37 +0000** - **haroldina:** cacalater?  
**2013-01-23 16:18:48 +0000** - **mbaxa:** how is that faster?  
**2013-01-23 16:18:59 +0000** - **jbecker:** it&apos;s definitely not faster  
**2013-01-23 16:19:03 +0000** - **jbecker:** and it&apos;s actually exactly what we&apos;re taught  
**2013-01-23 16:19:07 +0000** - **jbecker:** just with visuals instead of numbers  
**2013-01-23 16:19:14 +0000** - **motohooligan:** because Japan is awesome  
**2013-01-23 16:19:15 +0000** - **mbaxa:** no, so much slower  
**2013-01-23 16:19:17 +0000** - **Shinohara:** [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/multiplication-division/lattice_multiplication/v/lattice-multiplication](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/multiplication-division/lattice_multiplication/v/lattice-multiplication)  
**2013-01-23 16:19:26 +0000** - **Shinohara:** Khan Academy covers it  
**2013-01-23 16:19:35 +0000** - **Shinohara:** explains why it works too  
**2013-01-23 16:19:35 +0000** - **jbecker:** having numbers is far far more efficient  
**2013-01-23 16:19:52 +0000** - **jbecker:** it&apos;s just multiplying by counting one decimal place at a time basically  
**2013-01-23 16:19:55 +0000** - **scottnelle:** Be Confident!  
**2013-01-23 16:20:00 +0000** - **mbaxa:** kind of why numbers were invented  
**2013-01-23 16:20:02 +0000** - **motohooligan:** !s You do it!  
**2013-01-23 16:20:16 +0000** - **jbecker:** !s Like a Robot  
**2013-01-23 16:20:21 +0000** - **haroldina:** !s Don&apos;t Be Like A Robot  
**2013-01-23 16:20:30 +0000** - **jbecker:** mbaxa: that was my reaction when people were "blown away" by this  
**2013-01-23 16:20:50 +0000** - **Shinohara:** whoah, we&apos;re sponsoring?  
**2013-01-23 16:20:54 +0000** - *Shinohara works on GoPayment&ast;  *
**2013-01-23 16:20:55 +0000** - **mbaxa:** I mean okay, it is kind of neat, but not at all useful for more than 4 digits  
**2013-01-23 16:21:03 +0000** - **jbecker:** Shinohara: cool!  
**2013-01-23 16:21:13 +0000** - **jbecker:** mbaxa: and numbers less than like 5  
**2013-01-23 16:21:28 +0000** - **jbecker:** try 99 x 898  
**2013-01-23 16:21:31 +0000** - **jbecker:** pain in the ass  
**2013-01-23 16:22:52 +0000** - **jbecker:** autocorrect  
**2013-01-23 16:22:53 +0000** - **jbecker:** lol

**2013-01-23 16:23:53 +0000** - **motohooligan:** My son is dancing to QUIT!  
**2013-01-23 16:23:58 +0000** - **jbecker:** Angry Dan is a great freaking intro to Jim Dalrymple  
**2013-01-23 16:24:04 +0000** - **jbecker:** and this  
**2013-01-23 16:24:06 +0000** - **scottnelle:** Oh yeah! Angry Dan this Friday! Can&apos;t wait  
**2013-01-23 16:24:06 +0000** - **jbecker:** is the news  
**2013-01-23 16:24:07 +0000** - **jbecker:** lol  
**2013-01-23 16:24:10 +0000** - **crumpf:** I had to sign into chat just b/c the Quit! song was playing.  
**2013-01-23 16:24:11 +0000** - **byrnbaker:** Hulk out!  
**2013-01-23 16:24:39 +0000** - **motohooligan:** They should sell a 5by5 soundtrack  
**2013-01-23 16:25:07 +0000** - **Zearin:** [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin) : Does the Quit! song have a name?  
**2013-01-23 16:25:13 +0000** - **Harish_:** oh they so should! I like the Amplified one especially. I seem to remember that it was created by Jim  
**2013-01-23 16:25:17 +0000** - **mbaxa:** dj dan in the morning  
**2013-01-23 16:25:41 +0000** - **haroldina:** danbenjamin: It&apos;s a trojan. It&apos;s actually installing Yellow Dog Linux  
**2013-01-23 16:25:51 +0000** - **mbaxa:** RH 3  
**2013-01-23 16:25:59 +0000** - **Harish_:** Centos  
**2013-01-23 16:26:09 +0000** - **Harish_:** Even better Debian  
**2013-01-23 16:26:12 +0000** - **Zearin:** Does the Quit! theme have a name?  
**2013-01-23 16:27:03 +0000** - **crumpf:** [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin): When does all the Quit! merchandise get announced?  
**2013-01-23 16:27:57 +0000** - **theTiger:** This is that 2012 SuperMix?  
**2013-01-23 16:27:59 +0000** - **crumpf:** Is this something Merlin created on Garage Band?  
**2013-01-23 16:28:02 +0000** - **byrnbaker:** I need Dans playlist  
**2013-01-23 16:28:22 +0000** - **jbecker:** Jim will love this when he comes on  
**2013-01-23 16:28:51 +0000** - **Shinohara:** I think I heard this on the radio a week or two ago  
**2013-01-23 16:29:29 +0000** - **jbecker:** danbenjamin: Cash even on the air? That&apos;s awesome. Converted.  
**2013-01-23 16:29:31 +0000** - **haroldina:** It&apos;s by DJ Earworm  
**2013-01-23 16:33:17 +0000** - **theTiger:** They&apos;ll fix it in post.  
**2013-01-23 16:35:11 +0000** - **crumpf:** [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin) [@haddiebird](http://twitter.com/haddiebird)  I don&apos;t think the Amplified notif has gone out yet.  
**2013-01-23 16:35:12 +0000** - **erifneerg:** so when Jim say the tempure is it in c or f?  
**2013-01-23 16:37:04 +0000** - **showbot:** [@5by5](http://twitter.com/5by5): Amplified with [@jdalrymple](http://twitter.com/jdalrymple) &amp; [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin) is starting now - [http://t.co/sI19cI8S](http://t.co/sI19cI8S) (59 seconds ago)  
**2013-01-23 16:37:17 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** Samsung is insane. They even mock their own users  
**2013-01-23 16:38:23 +0000** - **crumpf:** I really don&apos;t understand the Samsung brand.  
**2013-01-23 16:38:32 +0000** - **Harish_:** Samsung have no idea, they seem to be the Microsoft of the 21st century, just copy what is working well for others and hope for the best  
**2013-01-23 16:38:37 +0000** - **Tom____:** Its a really lame commercial  
**2013-01-23 16:40:01 +0000** - **Harish_:** why not just be innovative  
**2013-01-23 16:40:08 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** they keep showing that phone-rubbing trick  
**2013-01-23 16:40:09 +0000** - **Tom____:** Is it so much that they&apos;re going after Apple rather than Blackberry.  Apple has been making massive inroads into enterprises.  
**2013-01-23 16:40:20 +0000** - **Harish_:** set the world on fire with a new design that has not been seen before  
**2013-01-23 16:40:22 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** being innovative is not easy  
**2013-01-23 16:40:25 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** did it on the anti-iphone-users ads, did it in the family and santa porn ads, now again..  
**2013-01-23 16:40:35 +0000** - **boob:** came in late, is jim in a car?  
**2013-01-23 16:40:37 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** if it were, everybody would just do it  
**2013-01-23 16:40:56 +0000** - **crumpf:** @mvcmendes Yeah, all their commercials showcase.  Never once seen anyone do that in real life.  
**2013-01-23 16:41:04 +0000** - **Tom____:** The beard is mad today so its doing its best to muffle him.  
**2013-01-23 16:41:14 +0000** - **crumpf:** !s Hot Beard is Hot  
**2013-01-23 16:41:18 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** @crumpf absolutely  
**2013-01-23 16:41:25 +0000** - **Harish_:** of course it is not easy being innovative, but anything worth doing is never easy  
**2013-01-23 16:41:32 +0000** - **boob:** no one likes an angry beard  
**2013-01-23 16:41:54 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** @boob: Rovio&apos;s next big hit: Angry Beards  
**2013-01-23 16:42:04 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: but plenty of companies make money without innovating  
**2013-01-23 16:42:17 +0000** - **Harish_:** by copying, sadly very true :(  
**2013-01-23 16:42:41 +0000** - **haddiebird:** whatcha eatin&apos; Jim?  
**2013-01-23 16:42:46 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: not even by that - do you want your accountant to be innovative?  
**2013-01-23 16:42:48 +0000** - **boob:** was not impressed with the bb10 screenshots, maybe in use it has more to offer though  
**2013-01-23 16:42:53 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** haddiebird: a heineken can  
**2013-01-23 16:43:08 +0000** - **Harish_:** is my accountant designing and giving me software, computers, etc?  
**2013-01-23 16:43:16 +0000** - **Harish_:** or providing me an accountancy service?  
**2013-01-23 16:43:17 +0000** - **androok:** that forbes article is abysmal  
**2013-01-23 16:43:21 +0000** - **boob:** mvcmendes: likes his beer crunchy  
**2013-01-23 16:43:26 +0000** - **crumpf:** !s Stupid People Everywhere  
**2013-01-23 16:43:27 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: no, I just said companies in general  
**2013-01-23 16:43:59 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: and plenty of computer companies did well for years just providing boring me-too boxes  
**2013-01-23 16:44:02 +0000** - **Harish_:** I am not disagreeing with you, it is an interesting conversation to have  
**2013-01-23 16:44:16 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** it&apos;s only recently users have started even considering the design of their computers  
**2013-01-23 16:44:45 +0000** - **androok:** Right there, "emerging markets like China — are largely unwilling to pay a price premium" just shows how little of a clue forbes has.  
**2013-01-23 16:45:07 +0000** - **Harish_:** I mean I remember when Linux was in the &apos;underground&apos; and no one was touching it. I remember I was trying to write my dissertation project on Linux using Oracle RDBMS and Oracle didn&apos;t want to even hear anything about it  
**2013-01-23 16:45:25 +0000** - **Harish_:** but now&hellip;things have changed completely  
**2013-01-23 16:45:28 +0000** - **mindfad:** Someone dropped the brown acid.  
**2013-01-23 16:45:36 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: it&apos;s also possible to be too radical in your innovation, Apple in the 90s lost money because they tried to be too ahead of the curve  
**2013-01-23 16:46:01 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: if something works well, there&apos;s often no need to change it  
**2013-01-23 16:46:50 +0000** - **Harish_:** member:dsheehy_ I don&apos;t&apos; agree fully, if something works well, then we will never progress  
**2013-01-23 16:47:34 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** but change for change&apos;s sake can be pointless  
**2013-01-23 16:47:35 +0000** - **Harish_:** the mobile phone was working perfectly but since the iPhone things changed completely and now Android have started to push the state of the art forward, but it all still works  
**2013-01-23 16:47:44 +0000** - **erifneerg:** sounds like they want another Jobs CEO  
**2013-01-23 16:47:50 +0000** - **Tom____:** Jony is an artist....he&apos;s not interested in how to run a company  
**2013-01-23 16:48:19 +0000** - **androok:** Harish_: man...mobile was so broke. you ever own a palm or windows mobile phone?  
**2013-01-23 16:48:21 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Harish_: I&apos;d disagree -mobile phones before the iPhone were terrible  
**2013-01-23 16:48:41 +0000** - **erifneerg:** I nominate Josh Sircucas  for Apple CEO  
**2013-01-23 16:48:47 +0000** - **erifneerg:** &ast;john  
**2013-01-23 16:48:58 +0000** - **erifneerg:** blah  
**2013-01-23 16:48:59 +0000** - **Harish_:** Smartphones wasn&apos;t that popular, Nokia was my phone at that time  
**2013-01-23 16:49:18 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i don&apos;t really see android pushing the state of the art forward. it&apos;s still just a specs game there. google itself has good integrated online services, but that&apos;s separate from android hardware.  
**2013-01-23 16:49:23 +0000** - **Harish_:** can&apos;t remember the model numbers  
**2013-01-23 16:49:42 +0000** - **androok:** Nokia had a great symbian ecosystem, but they weren&apos;t really sold here. We had palm and windows mobile - both were abysmal in the years leading up to the iPhone  
**2013-01-23 16:49:54 +0000** - **Harish_:** @crucialwax the hardware definitely not, I should have specified the software is being pushed forward  
**2013-01-23 16:50:18 +0000** - **crucialwax:** Harish_ but with software, it&apos;s the non android stuff that is better.  
**2013-01-23 16:50:24 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** I think the smartphones of the time were even worse than dumbphones - too complex to operate, too unreliable and buggy  
**2013-01-23 16:50:32 +0000** - **crucialwax:** google isn&apos;t exactly open with it&apos;s best recipes.  
**2013-01-23 16:51:32 +0000** - **androok:** OHAI market manipulation.  
**2013-01-23 16:51:57 +0000** - **Harish_:** The non-android stuff is not always better  
**2013-01-23 16:52:22 +0000** - **Harish_:** I love iCloud and what it does, but my goodness I wish I could suggest changes which would make iCloud better and Apple would listen  
**2013-01-23 16:52:41 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i&apos;m specifically talking about google&apos;s non android proprietary stuff that runs on android.  
**2013-01-23 16:52:50 +0000** - **crucialwax:** that&apos;s the best thing about it.  
**2013-01-23 16:52:51 +0000** - **Harish_:** but if I do say anything via Twitter, the Apple forums etc, I don&apos;t even know if Apple will listen. Apple do things according to their own time  
**2013-01-23 16:53:13 +0000** - **crucialwax:** so you can get through to google?  
**2013-01-23 16:53:22 +0000** - **matthewb:** Is the apple death knell counter still going?  
**2013-01-23 16:53:34 +0000** - **boob:** its never stopped  
**2013-01-23 16:53:45 +0000** - **Harish_:** @crucialwax I run Android on a Parallels VM just to keep up-to-date with what is happening, I have never owned or used an Android divice per-se  
**2013-01-23 16:54:09 +0000** - **Harish_:** truth-be-told I don&apos;t use google services much anymore  
**2013-01-23 16:54:23 +0000** - **crucialwax:** some people love them.  
**2013-01-23 16:54:23 +0000** - **Harish_:** and believe it or not I am considered to be an apple fan boy  
**2013-01-23 16:55:01 +0000** - **Harish_:** and I want Apple to succeed and improve but if there was some way I could communicate my ideas across to Apple that would be soooooooooo good  
**2013-01-23 16:55:08 +0000** - **erifneerg:** when does apple come out with q4 report  
**2013-01-23 16:55:14 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** they push to find data that fits what they are trying to say  
**2013-01-23 16:55:19 +0000** - **boob:** today  
**2013-01-23 16:55:27 +0000** - **crucialwax:** apple is succeeding and improving. no problem there.  
**2013-01-23 16:55:37 +0000** - **boob:** or is it q1?  
**2013-01-23 16:55:37 +0000** - **crucialwax:** erifneerg, 23rd i believe  
**2013-01-23 16:55:38 +0000** - **erifneerg:** thanks boob  
**2013-01-23 16:55:46 +0000** - **erifneerg:** ah  
**2013-01-23 16:55:55 +0000** - **crucialwax:** oh heck. it&apos;s the 23rd already.  
**2013-01-23 16:56:07 +0000** - **boob:** 1:00 eastern  
**2013-01-23 16:56:16 +0000** - **boob:** (usually)  
**2013-01-23 16:56:52 +0000** - **androok:** the earnings per share for apple still rock, so I disagree with [@danbenjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin)&apos;s argument. the EPS is still a year over year improvement, even with all the crap happening in the market and lawsuits.  
**2013-01-23 16:59:55 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** What&apos;s the link to that Apple homepage thing?  
**2013-01-23 17:00:19 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** Im looking for it too  
**2013-01-23 17:00:50 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** it&apos;d be nice if dan posted links he&apos;s talking about here while the show is still running. the links that will become show notes, I mean  
**2013-01-23 17:01:19 +0000** - **erifneerg:** anyone got a link?  
**2013-01-23 17:01:28 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** is that it? [http://www.flickr.com/photos/kernelpanic/sets/283374/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kernelpanic/sets/283374/)  
**2013-01-23 17:01:30 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** Don&apos;t just describe it, give the URL!  
**2013-01-23 17:01:56 +0000** - **crumpf:** @mvcmendes I&apos;ve always hoped for that too, especially on The Frequency.  
**2013-01-23 17:02:03 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** that&apos;s not it. although this is a good compilation as well.  
**2013-01-23 17:02:50 +0000** - **erifneerg:** i hate aqua so much  
**2013-01-23 17:02:59 +0000** - **Harish_:** aqua is so nice  
**2013-01-23 17:03:19 +0000** - **boob:** loved aqua and the striped backgrounds back in the day  
**2013-01-23 17:03:21 +0000** - **Harish_:** I am doing work on CentOS right now and switching between GNOME and Aqua and trust me you really do see how good Aqua is  
**2013-01-23 17:03:58 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i gave my friend an old g5 imac stuck on tiger  
**2013-01-23 17:04:12 +0000** - **erifneerg:** "my pc wasn&apos;t plug-in-play it was plug n get mad"  
**2013-01-23 17:04:14 +0000** - **Harish_:** I wish there was a full fledged OS-X app that while the links are being added, the OS-X app would update. I love the OS-X menu bar app but a full fledged app, that would be so good  
**2013-01-23 17:04:18 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** jim just posted it on The Loop [http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/01/23/15-years-of-apples-homepage/](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/01/23/15-years-of-apples-homepage/)  
**2013-01-23 17:04:19 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i used it over winter break and it felt very very old school  
**2013-01-23 17:04:23 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** ye olde schoole  
**2013-01-23 17:04:32 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i regret never having own the lampshade  
**2013-01-23 17:05:07 +0000** - **danbenjamin:** !s monster company  
**2013-01-23 17:05:20 +0000** - **boob:** would still like Oscar the grouch for the trash can  
**2013-01-23 17:06:05 +0000** - **Harish_:** I can&apos;t wait to see what Jony Ive has in store for the next gen OS-X  
**2013-01-23 17:06:16 +0000** - **Harish_:** aqua++  
**2013-01-23 17:07:18 +0000** - **Harish_:** Ain&apos;t that the truth, people love to hate apple  
**2013-01-23 17:07:36 +0000** - **erifneerg:** i know people who love android for it being android  
**2013-01-23 17:07:51 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i do too  
**2013-01-23 17:07:53 +0000** - **cefranco2:** I know some people hat love Android. They&apos;ve even tried iOS but choose Android.  
**2013-01-23 17:08:01 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** work with developers, though  
**2013-01-23 17:08:03 +0000** - **cefranco2:** that&ast;  
**2013-01-23 17:08:20 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** not Normals  
**2013-01-23 17:08:31 +0000** - **Harish_:** most of the people I know who own android are software engineers, and they always say they can tinker with it, and I always say, I do tinker with a computer all day long, with a phone, I just want something which works and I don&apos;t have to tinker  
**2013-01-23 17:09:05 +0000** - **boob:** Harish_: thats common i think  
**2013-01-23 17:09:12 +0000** - **Harish_:** @boob yes I think so  
**2013-01-23 17:09:44 +0000** - **boob:** she doesn&apos;t care  
**2013-01-23 17:09:53 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i really dont feel like the difference really matters to most people  
**2013-01-23 17:09:54 +0000** - **crumpf:** I think most people with Android devices either get pushed that direction by an AT&T or VZW sales rep, or else purely on price because it appears to do pretty much what the iOS devices can.  
**2013-01-23 17:10:06 +0000** - **haroldina:** He&apos;s not getting an e-mail from me about this because I&apos;ve already sent it.  
**2013-01-23 17:10:06 +0000** - **just-ed:** !s SCREW APPLE!  
**2013-01-23 17:10:20 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** danbenjamin: try going to theverge.com  
**2013-01-23 17:10:28 +0000** - **androok:** I&apos;m a dev, and at our business all the other devs minus myself and one other all have android.  
**2013-01-23 17:10:32 +0000** - **boob:** "people familiar with the matter"  
**2013-01-23 17:10:38 +0000** - **crumpf:** I think the people that champion the configurability and open platform of Android are the vocal minority of tech nerds.  
**2013-01-23 17:10:41 +0000** - **androok:** They claim "I can write software for it..."  
**2013-01-23 17:10:51 +0000** - **androok:** and then I ask them - "What apps have you written?"  
**2013-01-23 17:10:55 +0000** - **androok:** "none..."  
**2013-01-23 17:11:04 +0000** - **crumpf:** androok, yep  
**2013-01-23 17:11:13 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** "i learned java in college... sooooo...."  
**2013-01-23 17:11:21 +0000** - **cefranco2:** LOL, He does know you &ast;can&ast; torrent Mac Apps right?  
**2013-01-23 17:11:22 +0000** - **androok:** It makes me laugh when they&apos;re constantly flashing roms and their bluetooth stops working  
**2013-01-23 17:11:25 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** "i don&apos;t like things that are different."  
**2013-01-23 17:11:44 +0000** - **androok:** "Oh dude, did you flash the new cyanogenmod"  
**2013-01-23 17:11:58 +0000** - **badhedgehog:** "vocal minority of tech nerds" EXACTLY  
**2013-01-23 17:12:00 +0000** - **androok:** "yeah, my camera isn&apos;t working right now but I think I&apos;ll stick with it for a bit"  
**2013-01-23 17:12:00 +0000** - **erifneerg:** i just remember how i read that apple killed the linux desktop from getting any traction  
**2013-01-23 17:12:04 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** androok: works awesome! i just can&apos;t put the screen to sleep now!  
**2013-01-23 17:12:09 +0000** - **crucialwax:** android is open to the phone makers. not to the end user. that open thing is pretty much meaningless. the best of what android offers is google closed source stuff, and that&apos;s it&apos;s own walled garden in reality. it&apos;s good stuff, but know what it is.  
**2013-01-23 17:12:43 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** but crucialwax , "open" souuunnnnddds better  
**2013-01-23 17:12:46 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: yep. My time is worth so much more to me these days. When I reach into my pocket, I expect my phone to behave exactly how I expect it to 99% of the time.  
**2013-01-23 17:12:46 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** its a more gooder word.  
**2013-01-23 17:12:53 +0000** - **esoel_:** what I don&apos;t like about android is that I&apos;m not their customer  
**2013-01-23 17:12:56 +0000** - **crucialwax:** HoldSteady, it does sound pretty awesome, huh.  
**2013-01-23 17:13:04 +0000** - **androok:** yet I still write apps for Android when required.  
**2013-01-23 17:13:21 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** android runs javascript in a browser just fine, does that count?  
**2013-01-23 17:13:22 +0000** - **esoel_:** I&apos;m their product  
**2013-01-23 17:13:24 +0000** - **badhedgehog:** Neither manufacturers nor carriers &ast;want&ast; things to be open to the end user.  
**2013-01-23 17:13:46 +0000** - **erifneerg:** or watch The NFL  
**2013-01-23 17:13:50 +0000** - **androok:** I have an old HTC Evo in my drawer at home for dev though.  
**2013-01-23 17:14:01 +0000** - **boob:** maytag was first  
**2013-01-23 17:14:33 +0000** - **alasdoradas:** There are lots of people who prefer one side over the other. Friends who are tied into the Google ecosystem often go with Android and would not consider anything else  
**2013-01-23 17:14:42 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i actually run an HTC One as my main phone  
**2013-01-23 17:14:50 +0000** - **crucialwax:** of movies I actually buy, it&apos;s dvds. but i consume far more movies via netflix. i much prefer that.  
**2013-01-23 17:14:52 +0000** - **androok:** has anyone attempted to use their &apos;digital copy&apos; of a movie with a bluray they&apos;ve purchased?  
**2013-01-23 17:14:58 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** generally, i use an ipod touch when around the house, however  
**2013-01-23 17:14:58 +0000** - **haroldina:** Yes  
**2013-01-23 17:15:01 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: you run stock firmware?  
**2013-01-23 17:15:07 +0000** - **erifneerg:** you know it bugs me apple stop realising darwin&apos;s source  
**2013-01-23 17:15:13 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** androok: HTC Sense, didn&apos;t fiddle at all  
**2013-01-23 17:15:24 +0000** - **haroldina:** androok: we&apos;ve done the downloads on the wife&apos;s Mac Mini so she doesn&apos;t have to deal with discs.  
**2013-01-23 17:15:27 +0000** - **crumpf:** !s I Want it Now  
**2013-01-23 17:15:38 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** androok: also don&apos;t have time for nonsense roms and firmware updates  
**2013-01-23 17:15:57 +0000** - **androok:** haroldina: I tried using the ultraviolet service and was extremely disappointed. I ended up finding the link to request my itunes download link.  
**2013-01-23 17:16:23 +0000** - **haroldina:** Oh, you&apos;re talking specifically about Ultraviolet?  
**2013-01-23 17:16:31 +0000** - **haroldina:** All the ones we&apos;ve done have been codes for iTunes  
**2013-01-23 17:16:45 +0000** - **alasdoradas:** Ultraviolet is the new push for digital movie copies  
**2013-01-23 17:16:54 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: yeah, that&apos;s probably an excellent choice.  
**2013-01-23 17:17:14 +0000** - **haroldina:** As long as it means they stop calling the downloads "digital copies" I&apos;m all inl.  
**2013-01-23 17:17:18 +0000** - **haroldina:** &ast;in  
**2013-01-23 17:17:21 +0000** - **androok:** haroldina: yeah - in the copies we bought around the holidays, it seemed like they were really pushing ultraviolet  
**2013-01-23 17:17:39 +0000** - **crucialwax:** the digital hub started at next. it was jobs whole thing with that OS.  
**2013-01-23 17:17:40 +0000** - **androok:** we had to go to a request page to get our itunes codes  
**2013-01-23 17:18:12 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** lately, i&apos;d rather just rent things on demand, i don&apos;t want this garbage piling up in my house  
**2013-01-23 17:18:22 +0000** - **erifneerg:** that was such a cool sound to me as a child  
**2013-01-23 17:18:27 +0000** - **haroldina:** score! I got 2 Frequency titles in a row!  
**2013-01-23 17:18:43 +0000** - **crumpf:** wow, I haven&apos;t thought about mechanical shuffle in a long time.  
**2013-01-23 17:18:56 +0000** - **haroldina:** My dad still has a 5-disc changer.  
**2013-01-23 17:18:56 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** my dad had one of those  
**2013-01-23 17:19:04 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** 20 seconds of waiting time as it shuffles  
**2013-01-23 17:19:12 +0000** - **haroldina:** And I&apos;m sure my old roommate still has the 100-disc changer.  
**2013-01-23 17:19:48 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** do you guys still use itunes to play music?  
**2013-01-23 17:20:01 +0000** - **haroldina:** Yeah  
**2013-01-23 17:20:06 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** I like slide 128 on that Apple homepage thing  
**2013-01-23 17:20:07 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** "Introducing: The Daily"  
**2013-01-23 17:20:11 +0000** - **androok:** does itunes on the iPhone or ipad mini count?  
**2013-01-23 17:20:15 +0000** - **androok:** the &apos;music&apos; app  
**2013-01-23 17:20:19 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i find now its just pandora and songza, and maybe grooveshark if i am craving one specific song  
**2013-01-23 17:20:20 +0000** - **erifneerg:** what else would i use HoldSteady ?  
**2013-01-23 17:20:28 +0000** - **erifneerg:** oh  
**2013-01-23 17:20:31 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** honestly, I&apos;ve been listening to jazz radios on itunes. had never done that. turns out there are quite a few good ones.  
**2013-01-23 17:20:40 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** erifneerg: i just don&apos;t really have an interest in stockpiling mp3s anymore  
**2013-01-23 17:20:53 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** i have tons, but i have kind of stopped adding to the pile  
**2013-01-23 17:20:58 +0000** - **haroldina:** I use iTunes mostly, but I&apos;ve used Google Play a couple times because all of my music is there.  
**2013-01-23 17:21:19 +0000** - **haroldina:** Is somebody playing Immigrant Song on Jim&apos;s end?  
**2013-01-23 17:21:19 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** the beard is screaming  
**2013-01-23 17:21:26 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** and itunes is almost never my first instict when i think "i want music to be playing now.."  
**2013-01-23 17:21:52 +0000** - **haroldina:** I always have iTunes running to pull down my podcasts and have them lined up for the iPod I keep in my car.  
**2013-01-23 17:22:07 +0000** - **haroldina:** But away from the computer, I use my android phone a lot.  
**2013-01-23 17:22:14 +0000** - **haroldina:** (err, phones)  
**2013-01-23 17:22:24 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** haroldina: i have kind of siwtched over to pocketcasts for just directly downloading podcasts  
**2013-01-23 17:22:36 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** do you use something like that at all on the android phones?  
**2013-01-23 17:22:37 +0000** - **crucialwax:** HoldSteady, at home, i&apos;m accessing itunes music via an appletv most of the time.  
**2013-01-23 17:22:46 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: I liked pocketcasts more on android than I do on iOS  
**2013-01-23 17:22:54 +0000** - **haroldina:** HoldSteady: what, pocketcasts?  
**2013-01-23 17:23:08 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** crucialwax: i went full on crazy and plugged a computer into the tv and generally am just running chrome form music stuff  
**2013-01-23 17:23:14 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** &ast;for music stuff  
**2013-01-23 17:23:25 +0000** - **androok:** it&apos;s sad that pocketcasts isn&apos;t a universal ipad/iphone app, and doesn&apos;t use the geofencing trick for auto-downloading new podcasts.  
**2013-01-23 17:23:28 +0000** - **haroldina:** Possibly, but when iTunes downloads the podcast so I can put it on my iPod, it shows up on my phone automatically through Google Play Music  
**2013-01-23 17:24:42 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** haroldina: interesting idea.. so your phone will play the podcast streaming then?  
**2013-01-23 17:25:08 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** androok: the android version does support auto downloading, but i generally do not trust it to not do it at a bad time  
**2013-01-23 17:25:12 +0000** - **haroldina:** I have it set so my phone will download it so it&apos;s available anywhere, but I can also stream anything in my library.  
**2013-01-23 17:25:40 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: yeah, you can tell it to autodownload only over wifi, and you can tell it to use android&apos;s download manager  
**2013-01-23 17:25:51 +0000** - **haroldina:** I&apos;ve got a set of stuff it&apos;ll automatically sync and the rest is just on the servers for streaming.  
**2013-01-23 17:25:57 +0000** - **haroldina:** Anyway, I need to get to work.  
**2013-01-23 17:26:02 +0000** - **haroldina:** later, jackals.  
**2013-01-23 17:26:03 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** haroldina: I like google play music, i use it as well - in fact, if there is something i want to play from itunes library, i often go there througha browser before even launching itunes  
**2013-01-23 17:26:08 +0000** - **androok:** HoldSteady: I wish the iOS version would do the autodownloading via the "Apple approved of" geofencing hack  
**2013-01-23 17:26:29 +0000** - **androok:** I believe downcasts does this - though I&apos;m not certain  
**2013-01-23 17:27:01 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** what about office, do you guys use it?  
**2013-01-23 17:27:13 +0000** - **androok:** I got it for $10, so yeah.  
**2013-01-23 17:27:20 +0000** - **esoel_:** only at work on a mac :-)  
**2013-01-23 17:27:26 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** even if it was free, i would probably not use it  
**2013-01-23 17:27:28 +0000** - **androok:** [http://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/home.aspx?culture=en-US](http://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/home.aspx?culture=en-US)  
**2013-01-23 17:27:56 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** just haven&apos;t had a need i guess  
**2013-01-23 17:27:58 +0000** - **androok:** yeah, the mac version actually is pretty nice.  
**2013-01-23 17:28:17 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** do you have to do track-changes revisions with people, androok?  
**2013-01-23 17:28:29 +0000** - **androok:** when 2010 for pc, and 2011 for mac was released, I was astounded that they made the mac version so much nicer  
**2013-01-23 17:28:34 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** or, i guess excel, nothing is really equal to that, or so they say  
**2013-01-23 17:29:24 +0000** - **cr1:** yes, danbenjamin. a retina screen  
**2013-01-23 17:29:26 +0000** - **androok:** I do use excel workbooks people have sent me. I was surprised the vbscript macros worked on my mac.  
**2013-01-23 17:30:52 +0000** - **androok:** someone at my work taught the business people how to copy and paste excel macros they find off the internet....it&apos;s horrible.  
**2013-01-23 17:30:57 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** Jim, please tell Dan when the Mini will have retina.  
**2013-01-23 17:32:09 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** Forget producing it, how the hell will you drive a 27" screen at 5120x2880  
**2013-01-23 17:32:38 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** with a graphics chipset?  
**2013-01-23 17:33:25 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** It would be almost twice the pixels of 4K video  
**2013-01-23 17:34:10 +0000** - **thepriceisright:** I think that exceeds Thunderbolt&apos;s bandwidth, at least when running on copper  
**2013-01-23 17:34:45 +0000** - **androok:** the geforce gtx 690 max resolution - 4096x2160  
**2013-01-23 17:34:46 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** I doubt it  
**2013-01-23 17:34:59 +0000** - **cr1:** microsoft couldn&apos;t find their own backsides, even with a google map  
**2013-01-23 17:35:03 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** graphics chips are advancing rapidly  
**2013-01-23 17:35:29 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Haven&apos;t they shown Thunderbolt driving like 12 displays dais-chained?  
**2013-01-23 17:35:49 +0000** - **mvcmendes:** I wonder if jim is talking to himself on the other side. heh. how long until he notices  
**2013-01-23 17:35:52 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** talking ill of microsoft

**2013-01-23 18:00:35 +0000** - **HoldSteady:** what&apos;s the difference between gain and overdrive (if any) ?  
**2013-01-23 18:00:51 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** isn&apos;t overdrive just a different form of distprtion?  
**2013-01-23 18:02:24 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** I thought the ide is you are over-driving the amp to get a certain kind of sound, which is caused by distortion. If it wasn&apos;t being distorted, the sound wouldn&apos;t change  
**2013-01-23 18:02:42 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i suppose overdrive is specifically on the input, while distortion could be on output. no idea how they apply those words though.  
**2013-01-23 18:03:13 +0000** - **crucialwax:** or maybe overdrive is into the output? i have no idea  
**2013-01-23 18:03:25 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** crucialwax: I find musician jargon to be almost as arbitray as foodie&apos;s jargon  
**2013-01-23 18:03:37 +0000** - **crucialwax:** ha  
**2013-01-23 18:03:50 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** so much of it is not based on actual technical stuff or sound logic  
**2013-01-23 18:03:58 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** like "crunchy" for example  
**2013-01-23 18:04:09 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** or "pinchier" for that matter!  
**2013-01-23 18:04:46 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** this guitar has some floral noted heightened by cinnamon  
**2013-01-23 18:05:32 +0000** - **crucialwax:** from wiki: The terms "distortion", "overdrive" and "fuzz" are often used interchangeably, but they have subtle differences in meaning. Overdrive effects are the mildest of the three, producing "warm" overtones at quieter volumes and harsher distortion as gain is increased. A "distortion" effect produces approximately the same amount of distortion at any volume, and its sound alterations are much more pronounced and  
**2013-01-23 18:05:33 +0000** - **crucialwax:**  intense.  
**2013-01-23 18:06:08 +0000** - **crucialwax:** A fuzzbox (or "fuzz box”) alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier.  
**2013-01-23 18:06:35 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** I think the problem is using the generic word "distortion" for a specific effect  
**2013-01-23 18:06:45 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i tend to agree  
**2013-01-23 18:06:52 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** and the way these have evolved into effects units  
**2013-01-23 18:07:15 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** wasn&apos;t "overdrive" originally just done by turning up the pre-amp beyond its normal level?  
**2013-01-23 18:07:55 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** but these days the original techniques have turned into "effects pedals"  
**2013-01-23 18:08:37 +0000** - **crucialwax:** we no longer need to heat our igloos with frequency splatter into the infrared  
**2013-01-23 18:09:11 +0000** - **dsheehy_:** Jim just heats his igloo with his amps
