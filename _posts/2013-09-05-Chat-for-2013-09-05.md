**2013-09-05T14:39:15+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** Vis-à-vis Nokia  
**2013-09-05T14:39:52+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** big week.  
**2013-09-05T14:39:56+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** going to preemptively call it  
**2013-09-05T14:39:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** 5by5 SPECIAL: BREAKING NEWS: Horace comments Microsoft purchase of Nokia  
**2013-09-05T14:40:03+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** !s Vis-à-vis Nokia  
**2013-09-05T14:40:06+00:00** - **&lt;JACKALandHYDE&gt;** Oooooo. Special  
**2013-09-05T14:40:08+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** sweeeeetness  
**2013-09-05T14:40:22+00:00** - **&lt;truemarmalade&gt;** Good way to start my day  
**2013-09-05T14:40:48+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** Marco bought Nokia and sold it to Microsoft  
**2013-09-05T14:40:53+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I have a friend who works at Nokia who is worried, in that she is Finnish and would lose her work visa if she gets considered redundant after the acquisition completes  
**2013-09-05T14:41:07+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** prehnra: good use of that Tumblr money?  
**2013-09-05T14:41:09+00:00** - **&lt;HowardChicken&gt;** I'm here!  
**2013-09-05T14:41:12+00:00** - **&lt;HowardChicken&gt;** Why am I here?  
**2013-09-05T14:41:20+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** That's deep, man.  
**2013-09-05T14:41:30+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** To listen to Moisés talk to Horace about the Microsoft / Nokia news.  
**2013-09-05T14:41:50+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** UltraNurd: I don't think he even had to send the check before he sold it. Sort of a company "flip"  
**2013-09-05T14:41:53+00:00** - **&lt;HowardChicken&gt;** Ah, that's the special?  
**2013-09-05T14:42:00+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yeah :)  
**2013-09-05T14:42:01+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yes.  
**2013-09-05T14:42:09+00:00** - **&lt;HowardChicken&gt;** Cool  
**2013-09-05T14:42:12+00:00** - **&lt;Benny_&gt;** So this is not really a 5by5 special? More like a Critical path special?  
**2013-09-05T14:42:13+00:00** - **&lt;guestasaaaa&gt;** I don't hear any audio  
**2013-09-05T14:42:37+00:00** - **&lt;guestasaaaa&gt;** No, it's a 5by5 Special. Dan is announcing that 5by5 has been sold to Microsoft.  
**2013-09-05T14:42:37+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** guestasaaaa: reload. it works sometimes.  
**2013-09-05T14:42:57+00:00** - **&lt;Benny_&gt;** Finally!  
**2013-09-05T14:43:29+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it's a Special and an episode of Critical Path  
**2013-09-05T14:43:57+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** A Very Special Episode  
**2013-09-05T14:44:06+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** !s A Very Special Episode  
**2013-09-05T14:44:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** !s A Shock and A Surprise  
**2013-09-05T14:44:17+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** !s A Shock, but Not Exactly a Surprise  
**2013-09-05T14:44:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Words. >.>  
**2013-09-05T14:44:32+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** haha  
**2013-09-05T14:44:39+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** it is ON, buddy  
**2013-09-05T14:45:06+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** man, i thought i was going to get work done today.  
**2013-09-05T14:47:16+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** !s Contingency  
**2013-09-05T14:48:51+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Who else is excited for the september 10th event?  
**2013-09-05T14:49:12+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I am, hydr. Get to see my new phone. :D  
**2013-09-05T14:49:25+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Curious what else than 5S/5C they will announce, I expect a ton of new software updates to go with IOS7. iWork/iLife updates.  
**2013-09-05T14:49:32+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** hydr: I still want to know if maybe they've kept something completely under wraps  
**2013-09-05T14:49:51+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I'm kinda hoping for that graphite color rumor  
**2013-09-05T14:49:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** that it's at Town Hall is…curious  
**2013-09-05T14:50:00+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: Apple is moving to Windows Phone  
**2013-09-05T14:50:11+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** but you heard it here first  
**2013-09-05T14:50:11+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: they've done a great job of keeping it silent  
**2013-09-05T14:50:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Macworld was talking about an iPod update that I hadn't heard anything about yet, but that's not exactly surprising.  
**2013-09-05T14:50:23+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** moiseschiu, They can keep new products under complete wrap I think, but as soon as it goes into massproduction leaks occurs  
**2013-09-05T14:50:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** iPods are always September event, been that way solidly since I worked there  
**2013-09-05T14:50:47+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Mac Pro needs to be announced, and maybe iWatch. We were promised a new product category this fall  
**2013-09-05T14:50:55+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** but those could happen at the iPad event in october  
**2013-09-05T14:50:58+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** iWatch might turn out to be an television set.  
**2013-09-05T14:51:04+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Mac Pro probably not until the October "last of the year" update  
**2013-09-05T14:51:11+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** hydr: I like that theory, heard it a few places  
**2013-09-05T14:51:15+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Along with the iPads.  
**2013-09-05T14:51:32+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I'm still convinced that the AppleTV is the TV product until they are happy with margins for a 4K TV  
**2013-09-05T14:51:43+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I have this half baked blog post about a "free mac pro" which is an interesting idea to me  
**2013-09-05T14:51:54+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** basically apple selling the mac pro near-cost since it is such a drop in the bucket  
**2013-09-05T14:52:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Content deals as well, no? Seems that Apple would want both ends in place.  
**2013-09-05T14:52:07+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** to replace the now defunct ADC Premiere account  
**2013-09-05T14:52:15+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** and to really drag back pro users  
**2013-09-05T14:52:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** would never happen  
**2013-09-05T14:52:32+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** With the IOS ecosystem with iTunes, Apple has a real unique chance to distribute 4K content. This is the biggest hurdle for Samsung, Sony, LG, etc when it comes to UHD.  
**2013-09-05T14:52:42+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** with/and  
**2013-09-05T14:52:59+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Both in terms of movies, tv-series and apps/games.  
**2013-09-05T14:53:01+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I don't think it's so crazy moiseschiu. The Mac Pro itself shouldn't happen from a strict margin perspective. It's a culture product  
**2013-09-05T14:53:09+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** 4KTV with iTunes is totally feasible, since all the HD content in iTunes is delivered in PreRes  
**2013-09-05T14:53:10+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** manufacturing in the US also  
**2013-09-05T14:53:13+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** ProRes*  
**2013-09-05T14:53:49+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** that they give it away as part of an ultra-premium ADC membership? that is ridiculous  
**2013-09-05T14:54:16+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** maybe the dumb phone division was too entangled with the smart phone division?  
**2013-09-05T14:54:35+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** shared a significant amount of infrastructure and/or key people  
**2013-09-05T14:54:36+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** ?  
**2013-09-05T14:54:47+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** hydr: Apple's biggest hurdle is on the game side of things. They've hit the upward limit of touchscreen model  
**2013-09-05T14:54:58+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** moiseschiu, Apple TVs use h264 though - and with h265 on the verge of launching, timing could very well be perfect for a h265 driven 4K content delivery system.  
**2013-09-05T14:55:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I agree  
**2013-09-05T14:55:11+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** But just with apps and games they will have a lot of unique 4K content for such a device  
**2013-09-05T14:55:47+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: no I don't say that they give away the Mac Pro, just that they sell it at cost or near cost  
**2013-09-05T14:56:09+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** if you look at the old ADC premiere and the hardware discounts  
**2013-09-05T14:56:10+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** moiseschiu: wasn't there something in iOS 7 about game controllers? do you think they'd do a first-party one?  
**2013-09-05T14:56:11+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it sort of works out  
**2013-09-05T14:56:22+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** among my favorite iOS games are those that really make use of the touch model  
**2013-09-05T14:56:25+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Not sure where we are in terms of A7X/GPU performance with regards to 4K, but seeing competitors starting to launch 4K capture/playback I think they might be there now.  
**2013-09-05T14:56:28+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** UltraNurd: a lot in iOS 7 about game controllers, with controllers on hand at WWDC to play with  
**2013-09-05T14:56:42+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** afwaller: still makes no sense why they would make their premium device a low-margin offering  
**2013-09-05T14:56:44+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** either with swipe actions, or manipulating virtual game elements (especially good with quality board game implementations)  
**2013-09-05T14:56:53+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** maps and a patent portfolio  
**2013-09-05T14:57:02+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: it's low volume, not a profit center no matter what, and won't drag margins down overall since it is so low volume  
**2013-09-05T14:57:05+00:00** - **&lt;prehnra&gt;** sounds like a software company waiting to happen  
**2013-09-05T14:57:05+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** UltraNurd: I kinda hope not. They've never really "gotten" games  
**2013-09-05T14:57:18+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** There are a lot of UHD improvements to Mavericks, there is also the support for extending to Apple TV display.  
**2013-09-05T14:57:24+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** moiseschiu: maybe they got jsiracusa to consult on controller design  
**2013-09-05T14:57:35+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** UltraNurd: they wish  
**2013-09-05T14:57:49+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** UltraNurd: they have logitech doing controllers  
**2013-09-05T14:57:52+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** so, with what's left of Nokia, who makes all of the candy bar phones for Africa and similar markets?  
**2013-09-05T14:58:00+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I mean, that's basically all I saw in Mali  
**2013-09-05T14:58:01+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Microsoft  
**2013-09-05T14:58:06+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** weirdly, microsoft now makes those  
**2013-09-05T14:58:12+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** And with Mac Pro needing a 4K display.. the timing is perfect for a 4K display this year, but if it will turn out to be a thunderbolt display or an actual television set reminds to be seen :-)  
**2013-09-05T14:58:12+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** maybe they will stop making them  
**2013-09-05T14:58:16+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** maybe not  
**2013-09-05T14:58:23+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** but they have a 10 year license to make those dumbphones  
**2013-09-05T14:58:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** hydr: they always fall behind on displays relative to when everyone thinks they should  
**2013-09-05T14:59:08+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** hydr: Mac Pro doesn't NEED a 4K display, but it could certainly drive one  
**2013-09-05T14:59:13+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** moiseschiu, agreed  
**2013-09-05T15:00:09+00:00** - **&lt;mindfad&gt;** http://gallery.drfaulken.com/d/8616-1/EVERYONE.png  
**2013-09-05T15:00:19+00:00** - **&lt;mindfad&gt;** whoops, sorry about that  
**2013-09-05T15:00:48+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** afwaller, true, but I do think they need to be able to offer an 4K option for the new Mac Pro. I certainly want one.  
**2013-09-05T15:00:59+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: Apple's business now is iPhone, iPad, and some mac laptops. The Mac Pro won't matter. It's being pitched because Apple cares about having pro users, they care about programmers, and they care about their image. "Innovation My Ass" really exemplifies that feeling  
**2013-09-05T15:01:05+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Can't innovate my ass  
**2013-09-05T15:01:06+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I mean  
**2013-09-05T15:01:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** afwaller: part of how they're selling it is as being able to drive three 4K monitors  
**2013-09-05T15:01:21+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moiseschiu: yes but that doesn't mean they have to be APPLE monitors  
**2013-09-05T15:01:25+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it doesn't NEED apple monitors  
**2013-09-05T15:01:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** never said that  
**2013-09-05T15:01:59+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Apple is advertising the Mac Pro in theaters because it's a mindshare product  
**2013-09-05T15:02:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** there's a big pile of monitor margin $ to be made, and they already tend higher-res than everyone else anyway  
**2013-09-05T15:02:18+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Sent from my Thunderbolt Display  
**2013-09-05T15:02:21+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** afwaller, fact is though we don´t know that for sure. For all we know the Mac Pro will require a retina display to be driven.  
**2013-09-05T15:02:46+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** in my experience pros don't use the glossy apple monitors  
**2013-09-05T15:03:03+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** though moiseschiu probably knows more about that than me  
**2013-09-05T15:03:24+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** (video and photo professionals)  
**2013-09-05T15:03:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** you use different displays for different purposes: color grading, sampling what something looks like on a consumer display, etc  
**2013-09-05T15:03:53+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I wonder if they'll quietly announce Haswell iMacs on the 10th? or would that just happen on an "off" day?  
**2013-09-05T15:04:09+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** haswell is really unimpressive on the desktop UltraNurd  
**2013-09-05T15:04:24+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** afwaller: don't need the power-sipping?  
**2013-09-05T15:04:30+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I have a 4770 box next to a 3770 and they are basically the same performance  
**2013-09-05T15:04:33+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** graphics is a bit better  
**2013-09-05T15:04:43+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** UltraNurd: yes, don't need the power savings  
**2013-09-05T15:05:03+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I was holding off on a replace-the-MacPro1,1 purchase because I figured I should get the latest  
**2013-09-05T15:05:04+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** maybe more of a priority on iMac than PC workstations, but I feel like it's not a big deal  
**2013-09-05T15:05:19+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** obviously  
**2013-09-05T15:05:19+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** yes do not replace the mac pro yet  
**2013-09-05T15:05:19+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** wait  
**2013-09-05T15:05:25+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** for the new mac pro  
**2013-09-05T15:05:50+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it will be $8,000 if you believe moiseschiu  
**2013-09-05T15:05:57+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** ;)  
**2013-09-05T15:06:05+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the one I would buy will be  
**2013-09-05T15:06:37+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I think they will drop the margins down to near nothing  
**2013-09-05T15:06:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** so  
**2013-09-05T15:06:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** you've  
**2013-09-05T15:06:54+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** said  
**2013-09-05T15:07:06+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it would still be $4000 probably  
**2013-09-05T15:07:28+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** a 12 core single CPU xeon will not be cheap  
**2013-09-05T15:07:38+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** let alone dual FirePro custom form factor GPUs  
**2013-09-05T15:08:49+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** some of these xeon chips have "customer recommended prices" from intel of over $3k  
**2013-09-05T15:08:52+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** just for the processor  
**2013-09-05T15:08:57+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I only see one downfall by using a glossy screen, and that´s reflections - and I´m certain that Apple will "get it right" when they launch the next displays be thunderbolt or a television set.  
**2013-09-05T15:08:59+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** that's not what Apple would pay, but sheesh  
**2013-09-05T15:10:41+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** also know that the upcoming xeon e5 2600 v2 chips are actually ivy bridge  
**2013-09-05T15:10:44+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** not haswell based  
**2013-09-05T15:11:22+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** pre order pricelist for the xeon e5 2600 v2 chips with 12 cores are around $3000 for just the CPU  
**2013-09-05T15:11:28+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** http://www.anandtech.com/show/7214/xeon-e52600-v2-price-list-server-ivy-bridgeep  
**2013-09-05T15:13:51+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I think 12core would be the maxed out mac pro, hopefully they´ll offer lower core versions just like they do today.  
**2013-09-05T15:14:01+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** assuredly they will  
**2013-09-05T15:14:04+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** MOAR COARZ  
**2013-09-05T15:14:14+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** they will probably have 6 cores, 8, 10, and 12  
**2013-09-05T15:14:19+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** yep  
**2013-09-05T15:14:50+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** NahKia  
**2013-09-05T15:14:57+00:00** - **&lt;AlbatrossD&gt;** !current  
**2013-09-05T15:15:05+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** that feels like a lot of SKUs, especially if there are other types of differentiation, like GPUs  
**2013-09-05T15:15:30+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** b_: yes, some will likely be CTO only  
**2013-09-05T15:15:49+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it's not a big deal for Apple to offer a few other CPUs since they are drop in replacements within a certain socket  
**2013-09-05T15:16:09+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** Ah, that makes sense  
**2013-09-05T15:16:30+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** also a 6 core at 3.5Ghz will spank a 12core at 2.4Ghz for many, many tasks  
**2013-09-05T15:16:53+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** not everything is multicore enough to max out 12 physical, 24 HT cores  
**2013-09-05T15:17:06+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** so for many users the 12 core model will be pointless  
**2013-09-05T15:17:23+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I could see Apple not offering it as a standard boxed model, making it CTO only  
**2013-09-05T15:17:23+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** Very few things are multicore enough to max out 6 of these cores ;)  
**2013-09-05T15:17:27+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** is there enough of a market of 3rd-party thunderbolt displays for Apple to get out of displays, like they left printers?  
**2013-09-05T15:17:41+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** UltraNurd: no. displayport, yes.  
**2013-09-05T15:18:07+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Thunderbolt displays: some of the only actual Thunderbolt accessories  
**2013-09-05T15:18:13+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I have a monoprice displayport 27" and it's great for the price (around 450)  
**2013-09-05T15:18:23+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** moiseschiu: with Seiki offering a 50" 4K display for as low as $950USD - why aren´t LG, Samsung, Sony following? Are they afraid of disrupting the market with low-cost options?  
**2013-09-05T15:18:34+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** Also, apple might want to push high-dpi monitors as well, which haven't really been coming from third parties.  
**2013-09-05T15:18:34+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** hydr: exactly  
**2013-09-05T15:18:54+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Apple will want to do retina desktop displays eventually, 50" 4K does not qualify.  
**2013-09-05T15:18:54+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** It´s like they are slowly milking a old well established market.  
**2013-09-05T15:19:17+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** Seiki's 39" looks like an awesome monitor, but it only supports HDMI 1.4, so there's no 4K@60hz  
**2013-09-05T15:19:17+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-Digital-SE39UY04-39-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00DOPGO2G  
**2013-09-05T15:19:21+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** only $699  
**2013-09-05T15:19:32+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** LG, Samsung, and Sony are operating with the same controlled-price reduction scheme they have for years  
**2013-09-05T15:20:13+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** squeezing every drop of money they can out of people on expected repurchase timelines  
**2013-09-05T15:20:24+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** The time is right for an outsider disrupting well established players.  
**2013-09-05T15:20:25+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** !s Certain Kind of Magic  
**2013-09-05T15:20:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Apple will get there, undoubtedly. Their screen component footprint is insane  
**2013-09-05T15:21:35+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** *nods* sooner than later I hope. Not sure about 10th september, but I sure hope they will announce something soon, even if it won´t be available until later this year.  
**2013-09-05T15:21:36+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** Well, if apple releases a $1,000-2,000 4k monitor alongside the mac pro, I can see the attach rate being insane  
**2013-09-05T15:22:38+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** yeah  
**2013-09-05T15:22:43+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** almost regardless of size  
**2013-09-05T15:23:26+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** though it will still be very low volume  
**2013-09-05T15:23:26+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** I'm not even sure what size I would prefer. 27" is perfect for 2560x1440, but not sure how much bigger I would want a 4k display to be.  
**2013-09-05T15:23:28+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** just like the mac pro  
**2013-09-05T15:23:40+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** display/tv - what´s the different when we are talking 4K? just the content.  
**2013-09-05T15:23:53+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** b_: as someone who uses a 27" 2560x1440 I would love to see a true retina 27"  
**2013-09-05T15:24:03+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** versus a hidpi mode  
**2013-09-05T15:24:05+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** hydr: Yeah, it just helps to differentiate the use case  
**2013-09-05T15:24:12+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** which is a bit of a joke low resolution  
**2013-09-05T15:24:41+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Walking into any Apple store, you always see a LG, Samsung, Sony or Phillips TV attached to those Apple TVs. I always though Steve Jobs must have hated that. :-) It looks so misplaced among those other products.  
**2013-09-05T15:24:47+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I tried to use the 27" at 1280x720 but it was weird and stupid  
**2013-09-05T15:24:48+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** yeah, having a 27" hidpi 1080p would be pretty awesome.  
**2013-09-05T15:24:50+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** not high enough  
**2013-09-05T15:25:14+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** (not by setting it to 1280x720 but through hiDPI mode)  
**2013-09-05T15:25:23+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** ie retina mode  
**2013-09-05T15:25:30+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** hydr: definitely. But there's a limit to how much of the vertical you can own, even for apple.  
**2013-09-05T15:25:44+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** b_: very true.  
**2013-09-05T15:25:58+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** afwaller: yes, I mean a 4k =hidpi=> 1080  
**2013-09-05T15:26:29+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** yeah, I think the displays are very hard to cut at those sizes with that density without a ton of dead pixels  
**2013-09-05T15:27:36+00:00** - **&lt;danmaree&gt;** microsoft's last chance to get mobile right  
**2013-09-05T15:27:41+00:00** - **&lt;b_&gt;** well, the nice part is that the customers aren't price sensitive, so apple can do low-yield low-volume and still make money per display.  
**2013-09-05T15:28:01+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** danmaree: getting it right doesn't mean it will succeed in the m arket place  
**2013-09-05T15:28:02+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** danmaree, odds stacked against them - but I hope they gets it right with Nokia.  
**2013-09-05T15:29:45+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** speaking of Nokia: http://www.dailytech.com/Quick+Note+Nokia+Mocks+Samsung+KitKat/article33317.htm  
**2013-09-05T15:29:45+00:00** - **&lt;danmaree&gt;**  <hydr> i hope so too - they're not evil, just another ibm that has reached the end of their curve. we need solid companies to keep challenging the industry  
**2013-09-05T15:29:57+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I think that Ballmer's resignation may be RELATED to the deal  
**2013-09-05T15:30:20+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** in the sense that the board doesn't think he can do it, or some activist investors don't want him leading it  
**2013-09-05T15:30:44+00:00** - **&lt;danmaree&gt;** afwaller: yup - agree - but either way - it was time for him to go  
**2013-09-05T15:30:53+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** I think the board finally made the decision to take a new course, and decided they had to buy Nokia and replace Ballmer taking it where it needed to go.  
**2013-09-05T15:31:20+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Elop is just as bad as ballmer though  
**2013-09-05T15:31:32+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** elop believed that the burning platform memo was a good idea  
**2013-09-05T15:31:43+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** believed that WinPho was going to work  
**2013-09-05T15:31:45+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** kept believing  
**2013-09-05T15:32:59+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** they need a strong visionary, but their whole business model is based on legacy. Which is not very compatible with todays tech, you need to reinvent yourself often to succeed.  
**2013-09-05T15:33:38+00:00** - **&lt;danmaree&gt;** MS should try buying a network too  
**2013-09-05T15:34:25+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I like the stratechery conspiracy theory  
**2013-09-05T15:34:31+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** However, they don’t join the board for another month. And so, Ballmer and the board, fully committed to becoming a devices company, pushed through the Nokia acquisition (ValueAct had no idea), locking in the devices and services strategy (and the reorg to a functional organization).  
**2013-09-05T15:34:31+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Shades of the old Microsoft, to say the least.  
**2013-09-05T15:34:31+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** ValueAct, who is opposed to Microsoft’s push into devices, was dissuaded from a proxy fight last Friday (the last day to file their intentions). The price? Steve Ballmer as CEO.  
**2013-09-05T15:34:37+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** http://stratechery.com/2013/another-nokia-explanation-the-same-conclusion/  
**2013-09-05T15:37:24+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Has there been any new rumors of Apple acquiring Yahoo?  
**2013-09-05T15:37:29+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** hahaha  
**2013-09-05T15:40:21+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Our Location Content team, which leads NAVTEQ Maps, is headquartered in Chicago, IL, USA supported by more than 7,000 Location & Commerce employees worldwide. We also have owned and operated production centers located in Fargo, North Dakota, USA; Leon, Mexico; Veldhoven, Netherlands and Mumbai, India.  
**2013-09-05T15:40:28+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** mostly still in chicago according to that  
**2013-09-05T15:40:50+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** !s Would you like Services with that?  
**2013-09-05T15:41:15+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** I think there is a former navteq office here in Boston area  
**2013-09-05T15:42:48+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** navteq still operates mostly independently  
**2013-09-05T15:42:52+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** and has preserved their branding  
**2013-09-05T15:43:05+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** so it would be a current navteq office unless it closed  
**2013-09-05T15:43:08+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** then it would be former :)  
**2013-09-05T15:46:31+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** create another zynga failure  
**2013-09-05T15:50:43+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** !s A Hopeful Ending  
**2013-09-05T15:51:04+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** !s Not a Happy Ending, But a Hopeful Ending  
**2013-09-05T15:51:58+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** oh maybe I'm confusing navteq with a different acquisition  
**2013-09-05T15:55:03+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** Apple  
**2013-09-05T15:55:09+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** will dominate next week  
**2013-09-05T15:55:20+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** kind of makes you wonder about the timing of this announcement  
**2013-09-05T15:55:24+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** idly  
**2013-09-05T15:55:35+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** likely unrelated, but still interesting  
**2013-09-05T15:55:42+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** Hope they can surprise us with a new category, but doubtful.  
**2013-09-05T15:55:52+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** cook PROMISED investors a new category  
**2013-09-05T15:55:53+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** holiday weekend is kind of a good way to bury  
**2013-09-05T15:55:55+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** at least in the US  
**2013-09-05T15:55:57+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** mac pro seems not to qualify  
**2013-09-05T15:56:06+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** MAYBE iPhone 5C qualifies as a "new category" but that seems dumb  
**2013-09-05T15:56:19+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** afwaller, no he promised investors new categories.  
**2013-09-05T15:56:20+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** cook can't promise investors something and not deliver without an explanation  
**2013-09-05T15:56:43+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** didn't he just say before the end of the year?  
**2013-09-05T15:56:46+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** yes  
**2013-09-05T15:56:47+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** not necessarily at 10th event  
**2013-09-05T15:56:49+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** so it could be any time  
**2013-09-05T15:56:57+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** but you're right that the stock could be punished  
**2013-09-05T15:57:07+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** well not just stock  
**2013-09-05T15:57:12+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** on the other hand, the colors plus 5C might be enough to assuage the "it doesn't look different" crowd  
**2013-09-05T15:57:20+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** SEC implications  
**2013-09-05T15:57:39+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** they need another product out this year, beside iphone/ipad/mac.  
**2013-09-05T15:57:47+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** I don't think they need one  
**2013-09-05T15:57:53+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** but they claimed they would have a new product  
**2013-09-05T15:58:09+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** it will look bad if they don't  
**2013-09-05T15:58:57+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** whatever they show, I hope it´s magical in a way only apple can do.  
**2013-09-05T15:59:53+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** maybe internal politics  
**2013-09-05T16:00:13+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** forcing out forstall was a big deal  
**2013-09-05T16:00:33+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** plus they had a lot of resources rededicated to iOS 7, including some of the hardware design guys  
**2013-09-05T16:01:07+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** by the looks of IOS7, the forestall decision was excellent. IOS7 has given us a lot of advances.  
**2013-09-05T16:02:47+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** very good point horace  
**2013-09-05T16:03:26+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** iOS 7 was only part of it  
**2013-09-05T16:03:34+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** moving out forstall was a big reorg  
**2013-09-05T16:03:40+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** thanks moiseschiu  
**2013-09-05T16:03:51+00:00** - **&lt;hydr&gt;** yeah thanks for a great podcast  
**2013-09-05T16:03:52+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** thanks moiseschiu  
**2013-09-05T16:06:21+00:00** - **&lt;UltraNurd&gt;** someday, jackals, someday I will remember you can't do string equality with == in Java  
**2013-09-05T16:15:15+00:00** - **&lt;marvin___&gt;** hi,..  
**2013-09-05T16:18:13+00:00** - **&lt;afwaller&gt;** hi  
**2013-09-05T16:41:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Oh, god. Peter Sagal retweeted a picture from David Rees. It's a picture of the same type of airport bench that I was taking apart when I ripped my hand open.

**2013-09-05T16:44:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Fun.  
**2013-09-05T16:45:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Which reminds me...  
**2013-09-05T16:48:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Looks good.  
**2013-09-05T16:48:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yup. All the deep stuff closed up nicely.  
**2013-09-05T16:49:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I can put my hands together and have a little railroad.  
**2013-09-05T16:49:10+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Lunchtime for me.. Back shortly.  
**2013-09-05T17:11:17+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** God, I love it when people want me to reconfigure something for them and give me pictures with no measurements and no other information.  
**2013-09-05T18:03:44+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I have a random tooltip on my screen, I have no idea which app it came from, but it won't die.  
**2013-09-05T18:03:51+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Is there an easy way to clear that?  
**2013-09-05T18:04:55+00:00** - *haroldina resists giving the standard IT Crowd answer*  
**2013-09-05T18:05:07+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I have no idea, and I hate when that happens  
**2013-09-05T18:05:23+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Ha, I'm guessing the standard IT Crowd answer is to reboot  
**2013-09-05T18:05:34+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** "Have You Tried Restarting"  
**2013-09-05T18:05:41+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** "Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"  
**2013-09-05T18:05:53+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I would hate to do that since I'm finally in the middle of upgrading the 5by5 minecraft server and all of my windows are set up *just right*  
**2013-09-05T18:05:59+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Scumbag tooltips  
**2013-09-05T18:06:22+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  
**2013-09-05T18:07:15+00:00** - **&lt;ghoppe&gt;** Hey! I set my coffee on that table!  
**2013-09-05T18:09:38+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/38012/yellow-tooltip-stuck-onscreen  
**2013-09-05T18:09:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It's an old one, but perhaps that could help  
**2013-09-05T18:12:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** josephrooks: please tell me the tooltip was from your IRC client  
**2013-09-05T18:13:06+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** It wasn't, I can't figure out what it was from  
**2013-09-05T18:13:27+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** It's a link to http://minecraft.5by5.tv but I think I've quit everything now and it's still up there  
**2013-09-05T18:14:12+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Bah, I'll just reboot...after my 1GB file transfer is done  
**2013-09-05T18:14:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I take it the instructions in the link I posted were of no help  
**2013-09-05T18:15:45+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** I'm not sure if I even have Quartz Debug  
**2013-09-05T18:16:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Ah, I misread that answer.  
**2013-09-05T18:16:52+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** Don't worry about it, I'll reboot in a sec  
**2013-09-05T18:16:55+00:00** - **&lt;josephrooks&gt;** It's only slightly annoying  
**2013-09-05T18:16:57+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was thinking it was saying Quartz Debug was built-in, but hidden.  
**2013-09-05T18:17:09+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** As opposed to a feature of Quartz Debug being hidden
