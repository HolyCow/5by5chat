**2013-10-24T11:02:08+00:00** - **&lt;ChAmp&gt;** hello....  
**2013-10-24T11:04:07+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** hi  
**2013-10-24T15:16:26+00:00** - **&lt;danbenjamin&gt;** !s Roll the Dice, I Won  
**2013-10-24T15:16:31+00:00** - **&lt;danbenjamin&gt;** !s Roll the Dice, I Won  
**2013-10-24T15:28:00+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** oy  
**2013-10-24T15:30:41+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** The iPad mini was the big thing for me. Retina and A7 was more than I dared hope for.  
**2013-10-24T15:33:59+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** http://cl.ly/S8BA  
**2013-10-24T15:34:02+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** someone shoot me  
**2013-10-24T15:34:04+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** please  
**2013-10-24T15:34:17+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** The iPads are great with the A7, but they are still constrained by the OS and I/O.  
**2013-10-24T15:34:25+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** i've tried so many times today. stupid shitty unstable cable here  
**2013-10-24T15:34:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** re being "real computers"  
**2013-10-24T15:35:13+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** i had downloaded about 4GB this time, and now I have to start all over again  
**2013-10-24T15:35:52+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** !s Monocle in my martini glass  
**2013-10-24T15:37:16+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** I'd love it if they looked to do an iPad "Pro"  
**2013-10-24T15:37:27+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** Keep the iPad Mini and iPad Air  
**2013-10-24T15:37:45+00:00** - **&lt;andrewkember&gt;** With a hinged flap that has a keyboard on it ;-)  
**2013-10-24T15:37:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And a kickstand?  
**2013-10-24T15:37:53+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** that runs OS X?  
**2013-10-24T15:38:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And a built-in app that teaches you to breakdance?  
**2013-10-24T15:38:13+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** iPad Air Surface Pro 2  
**2013-10-24T15:38:18+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** With the Macbook lines there's Macbook Air and Macbook Pro  
**2013-10-24T15:38:27+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** Desktops are Mac Mini, iMac, and Mac Pro  
**2013-10-24T15:38:29+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** And iOS apps in a Dashboard/Launchpad interface, why not. :|  
**2013-10-24T15:38:40+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** Why not bring that to the iPad line? iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro  
**2013-10-24T15:39:31+00:00** - **&lt;andrewkember&gt;** When you put it like that, it sounds more natural. What would you want on this iPad Pro on top of what you already get?  
**2013-10-24T15:40:02+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Why base the naming on desktops if they sell more Macbooks?  
**2013-10-24T15:40:02+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** SKU pandemonium!  
**2013-10-24T15:40:29+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** In fact, why not base their PC naming conventions on how they name iOS devices?  
**2013-10-24T15:40:30+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** haroldina: having common naming schemes is all about simplicity  
**2013-10-24T15:40:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** You don't have to tell me. Just look at trim levels on Ford pickups.  
**2013-10-24T15:41:08+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I challenge anybody to keep that straight.  
**2013-10-24T15:41:36+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But why not use the naming conventions of the devices they sell most of instead of what they sell least of?  
**2013-10-24T15:41:42+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** danbenjamin: thoughts on the iPad Mini Retina price bump?  
**2013-10-24T15:42:06+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** andrewkember: I'd love to see new I/O, maybe boot OS X? Keyboard? More power to do content creation? I'm really not sure

**2013-10-24T15:44:00+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** I should take my iPad 1 on Antiques Roadshow.  I've preserved the patina.  
**2013-10-24T15:44:33+00:00** - **&lt;andrewkember&gt;** greg_manley: So wads of power, but iPad form-factor. As Desktop replacement laptop is to Desktop PC, so iPad Pro would be to MacBook Pro?  
**2013-10-24T15:45:06+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** haroldina: I think they're better off using the naming from the computers because consumers can easily see the difference between  
**2013-10-24T15:45:21+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** "Pro", "Air", and "Mini"

**2013-10-24T15:46:23+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Does the iPad Air weigh less than the mini?  
**2013-10-24T15:47:29+00:00** - **&lt;greg_manley&gt;** andrewkember: I guess. I'm not really sure where Apple would go with "iPad Pro", but with the iPad Air name it makes a lot of sense to me that they'd give themselves room for the Pro eventually  
**2013-10-24T15:47:45+00:00** - **&lt;parks&gt;** haroldina: No, ipad mini weighs .73 and .75 pounds  
**2013-10-24T15:48:12+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I already find that a little confusing.  
**2013-10-24T15:48:49+00:00** - **&lt;parks&gt;** haroldina: What's confusing? That the Air weighs more than the Mini?  
**2013-10-24T15:48:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** If I hadn't seen everybody talking about them yesterday, I would have expected the Air to be a thinner mini  
**2013-10-24T15:52:52+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** In fact, when I looked at Apple's site and saw the iPad Air, I was trying to figure out why I didn't find one that was bigger and more capable.  
**2013-10-24T15:53:31+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Which made me think perhaps the minis were heavier.

**2013-10-24T16:23:37+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** My aunt used to put her dog's pills in a peanut butter cup and throw it at the dog from across the room.  
**2013-10-24T16:23:39+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** _HolyCow: That sounds terrible and wonderful all at once.  
**2013-10-24T16:23:45+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Like, full wind up, fastball pitch.  
**2013-10-24T16:24:30+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** haroldina: sidearm or overhand?  
**2013-10-24T16:24:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** overhand  
**2013-10-24T16:24:57+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** bah sidearm is so underappreciated  
**2013-10-24T16:25:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** One time she missed and the dog went to eat it, but she was so used to the process that she shooed him away from it so she could start over.  
**2013-10-24T16:25:12+00:00** - **&lt;vscra&gt;** She gave chocolate to a dog?  
**2013-10-24T16:25:39+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It may have been a glob of peanut butter.  
**2013-10-24T16:25:45+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** This was 15 years ago.  
**2013-10-24T16:25:51+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I know peanut butter was involved.  
**2013-10-24T16:26:03+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisLTD&gt;** danbenjamin: that probably kills the SSD life  
**2013-10-24T16:26:06+00:00** - **&lt;vscra&gt;** if it was homemade then it must have been a blog of PB  
**2013-10-24T16:26:33+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Yeah, I honestly don't remember.  
**2013-10-24T16:27:03+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Knowing her, it could have been the innards of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup  
**2013-10-24T16:27:10+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** She's funny that way  
**2013-10-24T16:27:48+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** That and nuking it from orbit.

**2013-10-24T17:29:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** CC: Everyone person who complains about TextExpander not being on the Mac App Store.  
**2013-10-24T17:29:44+00:00** - *theTiger grumbles to self.*  
**2013-10-24T17:30:26+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** What about people that complain about TextExpander not being on the Google Play Store?  
**2013-10-24T17:31:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Because I'm considering making that a thing.  
**2013-10-24T17:31:05+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** They are exempt for now.  
**2013-10-24T17:31:19+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Damn  
**2013-10-24T17:32:23+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I've been making great strides in taking better care of myself and impotent rage was a keystone of that.  
**2013-10-24T17:32:38+00:00** - *theTiger gives haroldina a bucket because he's a nice guy.*  
**2013-10-24T17:32:54+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** For instance, I had to grind a bunch of rust today and I even put on a face shield  
**2013-10-24T17:32:55+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Also, not injuring yourself.  
**2013-10-24T17:33:01+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** And then yelled at it.  
**2013-10-24T17:33:31+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** grind it like Miley?  
**2013-10-24T17:33:35+00:00** - *haroldina screams into his brand new bucket*  
**2013-10-24T17:33:55+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** _HolyCow: I just said I used PPE. She, quite clearly, did not.  
**2013-10-24T17:34:29+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Imagine how many lightbulbs you could power if you could harness the power of twerking.  
**2013-10-24T17:34:41+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** 3?  
**2013-10-24T17:35:04+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** _HolyCow: The new iWork apps are rewrites and Apple has a history of putting out rewrites that are initially missing features.  
**2013-10-24T17:35:46+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** like ..... AppleScript  
**2013-10-24T17:36:07+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I am more concerned about inconsistent Applescript support.  
**2013-10-24T17:36:09+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Yes, that.  
**2013-10-24T17:36:40+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** at least 3  
**2013-10-24T17:37:03+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** This reminds me of something that bugged the crap out of me last week.  
**2013-10-24T17:37:07+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** acres and acres of twerk farms  
**2013-10-24T17:37:35+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I was watching a show called "How Do They Do It?" and the writers clearly didn't understand how electricity works.  
**2013-10-24T17:38:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** "The batteries in this truck can supply 100 kW in 15 minutes."  
**2013-10-24T17:38:40+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Do you mean "for 15 minutes" or "100 kWh in 15 minutes"?  
**2013-10-24T17:38:50+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Because boy is that a difference.  
**2013-10-24T17:39:23+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** So haroldina, what you're saying is that it was the science equivalent to the History channel.  
**2013-10-24T17:39:43+00:00** - **&lt;kubaner&gt;** Ancient Aliens is pure science.  
**2013-10-24T17:39:57+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** ......  
**2013-10-24T17:39:58+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It was on Science Channel, so yet.  
**2013-10-24T17:40:00+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** technically everything that happened happened in the past  
**2013-10-24T17:40:00+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** yes.  
**2013-10-24T17:40:13+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** This is a picture of me when I was older.  
**2013-10-24T17:40:19+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** BrGabriel: ++  
**2013-10-24T17:41:17+00:00** - **&lt;kubaner&gt;** haroldina, haha.  
**2013-10-24T17:41:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I will alter a Metallica quote here: "Just because we have Science in our name doesn't mean we have to show science."  
**2013-10-24T17:41:43+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Just like Christian Science.  
**2013-10-24T17:42:16+00:00** - **&lt;kubaner&gt;** Every "science" that has "science" in its name, is not science.  
**2013-10-24T17:42:20+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** But any time they talked about electricity or mechanical power, they managed to get something wrong.  
**2013-10-24T17:43:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Anyway, the new iWork apps don't lack Applescript support it is just limited beyond the standard dictionary.  
**2013-10-24T17:43:31+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** Sometimes I wonder if it is deliberate.  
**2013-10-24T17:45:34+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** They do it with just about everything no matter the discipline. Science, Religion, History, everything is given an erroneous turn. But why? I mean, they have consultants. It's just strange.  
**2013-10-24T17:45:46+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** Anyway, it bugs me.  
**2013-10-24T17:46:09+00:00** - **&lt;kubaner&gt;** BrGabriel, yeah, but it's the ratings.  
**2013-10-24T17:46:34+00:00** - **&lt;kubaner&gt;** People don't want shows with "Can this be proof of alien life?.. NO".  
**2013-10-24T17:46:59+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It bugs me enough when people do it normally, but when it's people that purport to actually be providing information about a topic can't get it right, it makes me want to invent a long-range slapping device.  
**2013-10-24T17:47:17+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** lol  
**2013-10-24T17:47:47+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Reach out and dope-slap someone.  
**2013-10-24T17:48:46+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** It makes me angry enough that I write sentences you can't diagram  
**2013-10-24T17:49:10+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** anyway. I slept in today and woke up to the dulcet sounds of Andy's voice. I need coffee.  
**2013-10-24T17:49:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That is a nice way to wake, or fall to sleep. (Don't be creepy.)  
**2013-10-24T17:55:15+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** I should probably eat some food before going to work on the car.  
**2013-10-24T17:55:39+00:00** - **&lt;haroldina&gt;** Wouldn't want to pass out while bleeding brakes and have to start over from the beginning.  
**2013-10-24T19:10:49+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** a reward for lurking jackals  
**2013-10-24T19:11:02+00:00** - *theTiger arches brow.*  
**2013-10-24T19:11:03+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** anyone want a free license for the Mac version of to-do app Things?  
**2013-10-24T19:11:25+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I actually already have one... Jackals.  
**2013-10-24T19:11:29+00:00** - *theTiger looks abouts.*  
**2013-10-24T19:11:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I use Omnifocus, but thanks.  
**2013-10-24T19:11:42+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** I'll grab one, if nobody else wants it  
**2013-10-24T19:11:46+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** i dont really need it tho  
**2013-10-24T19:11:59+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** no mac  
**2013-10-24T19:12:59+00:00** - **&lt;joacim&gt;** I used the trial a few years ago. It was nice, and it was helpful, but I don't really have anything that i need to put in things anymore  
**2013-10-24T19:33:18+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Jesse, I got the new iPad Air, wanna go make some meth?  
**2013-10-24T19:44:09+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** moiseschiu: um; sure?  
**2013-10-24T19:44:59+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** you'll actually use it, phil?  
**2013-10-24T19:51:22+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** philcrissman: check your PMs  
**2013-10-24T19:56:00+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** (via jbecker) Seems like Disney is about to find out that 'The Vault' doesn't mean much in a digital world: https://twitter.com/optshiftk/status/393459917631139840  
**2013-10-24T19:56:35+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** (also via mrbeefy)  
**2013-10-24T19:57:16+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** thanks, moiseschiu  
**2013-10-24T19:58:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** theTiger: oh boy howdy is that part of Screen Time 46  
**2013-10-24T19:58:57+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** 45 is a comic-con panel with the star of Defiance  
**2013-10-24T20:07:19+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** theTiger: waaaat.  
**2013-10-24T20:07:37+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Indeed.  
**2013-10-24T20:07:47+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Looking forward to hearing it, moiseschiu. :)  
**2013-10-24T20:09:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it's in post right now, probably up later today depending on Mark's load  
**2013-10-24T20:10:17+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** I guess I'm not buying any more disney/pixar films. We have toy story 1, 2, finding nemo, on the AppleTV. Last thing I want is to buy them and have them disappear.  
**2013-10-24T20:10:32+00:00** - *philcrissman shakes tiny fist at the empire of the mouse.*  
**2013-10-24T20:10:38+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** this is why I buy Blu-rays and rip my own "Digital Copies"  
**2013-10-24T20:10:53+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** er, that is, if I buy them, I suppose it will have to be physical media.  
**2013-10-24T20:11:11+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** moiseschiu: what you said. Though, I still haven't upgraded to a bluray.  
**2013-10-24T20:11:44+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it's good to have waited  
**2013-10-24T20:11:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the newer players are much faster and better  
**2013-10-24T20:12:22+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Or similar and much cheaper  
**2013-10-24T20:13:06+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** yep  
**2013-10-24T20:13:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and many early Blu-ray releases have been rereleased with better video transfers and audio tracks  
**2013-10-24T20:13:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the problematic ones, that is  
**2013-10-24T20:14:28+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Win for the luddites! PHYSICAL PHOREVER!  
**2013-10-24T20:20:50+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** woot.  
**2013-10-24T20:21:29+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** moiseschiu: good to know. Just as well I waited, then. :D  
**2013-10-24T20:22:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I kinda prefer that Criterion's strategy is "premium physical product, plus subscribe to Hulu Plus for digital streaming"  
**2013-10-24T20:23:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Especially with them moving to DVD/Bluray combo releases, though I would prefer something like Netflix.  
**2013-10-24T20:27:40+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the Hulu Plus streams are generally better than Netflix in terms of quality  
**2013-10-24T20:29:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I dislike the Hulu website and getting ads on content even when paying.  
**2013-10-24T20:29:14+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** there are no ads in the movies  
**2013-10-24T20:29:49+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and their TV content is generally much different than Netflix, and focused on just-aired shows  
**2013-10-24T20:30:34+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** There is in other content, and it is part of the basis for the preference. Different catalogue focus is another.  
**2013-10-24T20:30:45+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** fair enough  
**2013-10-24T20:31:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I enjoy the fact that I see fewer commercials when watching Hulu Plus than I do paying for cable  
**2013-10-24T20:31:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** All that aside, the Criterion Collection alone is worth the Hulu Plus price.  
**2013-10-24T20:31:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and how  
**2013-10-24T22:24:49+00:00** - **&lt;ghoppe&gt;** hey BraveIda. Full Album teaser. http://arcadefire.com/
