**2013-06-27T04:55:43+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The Changelog 94 with @adamstac &amp; @andrewpthorp - http://t.co/BH3gXztjVT (35 seconds ago)  
**2013-06-27T12:27:52+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Big week!  
**2013-06-27T13:21:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** CP about to go live  
**2013-06-27T13:22:18+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yay  
**2013-06-27T13:22:43+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: The Critical Path with @asymco &amp; @moiseschiu is starting now - http://t.co/MErWLdtI4S (22 seconds ago)  
**2013-06-27T13:22:46+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Cross Promotion?  
**2013-06-27T13:22:55+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Cheese Pizza.  
**2013-06-27T13:23:18+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Chess Pieces - "You're just a pawn"  
**2013-06-27T13:23:57+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Maybe they should have a weekly review clip show called "Cross Promotion"  
**2013-06-27T13:33:10+00:00** - **&lt;mbaxa&gt;** just have like a quick drop with the guest this week on which shows  
**2013-06-27T13:50:44+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Mornin all  
**2013-06-27T13:51:01+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** JorgePasada: Morning!  
**2013-06-27T13:54:18+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Man I hope we're talking about Edward Snowden right now  
**2013-06-27T13:54:37+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** cause what I'm hearing is good stuff  
**2013-06-27T13:59:22+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Damn, apple, always apple :-)  
**2013-06-27T13:59:59+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** philcrissman: Morning  
**2013-06-27T14:09:05+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** !s Branches of the Tree  
**2013-06-27T14:12:19+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** moiseschiu: Wasn't Tim Cook an IBM'er?  
**2013-06-27T14:12:29+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Compaq  
**2013-06-27T14:25:34+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** mbaxa: I'm told that is coming across all shows network-wide  
**2013-06-27T14:28:05+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Crossover is back?  
**2013-06-27T14:28:30+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** moiseschiu mbaxa missed what that question was… what came across all shows?  
**2013-06-27T14:28:35+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** So excited for Crossover, so sad I can't listen live  
**2013-06-27T14:28:48+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** cross-promotion spots, including guests etc  
**2013-06-27T14:28:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** moiseschiu excellent  
**2013-06-27T14:28:59+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** as you well know big thumbs up from me  
**2013-06-27T14:29:08+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** ThePrompt was great again this week, for those who haven't listened  
**2013-06-27T14:29:16+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** writing is hard  
**2013-06-27T14:29:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I'm totally a fan of the Nintendo/Apple talk  
**2013-06-27T14:29:25+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** ti-mer coalescing  
**2013-06-27T14:29:51+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** jbecker: What was it bout?  
**2013-06-27T14:30:10+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** moiseschiu I may more may not be behind the Time Koala Sing twitter account.  
**2013-06-27T14:30:36+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** JorgePasada they talked about the personality of the "Apple cult" if it's a cult, why there arne't more linked-list Gruber style blogs or other broad writing about any other comapny in the same way  
**2013-06-27T14:30:46+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** what about Apple led to that situation, perhaps, does anyone else look like this  
**2013-06-27T14:30:56+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** and does Apple have the ability to maintain that sort of … culture-share  
**2013-06-27T14:35:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Crossover  
**2013-06-27T14:35:56+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Shawn Blanc and Anna Debenham  
**2013-06-27T14:36:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** ooooo  
**2013-06-27T14:36:24+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I miss Crossover  
**2013-06-27T14:36:30+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I promise I'm not over-hyping tomorrow's Screen Time with Horace and Guy  
**2013-06-27T14:36:43+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I'm especially excited now that the 70db guys can be a part of Crossover  
**2013-06-27T14:36:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** moiseschiu I've already overhyped it  
**2013-06-27T14:37:26+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** we will get roundly dismissed as Apple fanboys I'm sure  
**2013-06-27T14:38:00+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** bc that's my topic structure: how impossibly big a lead Apple have  
**2013-06-27T14:38:25+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** No longer live?  
**2013-06-27T14:39:13+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I think that's a perfectly reasonable structure for the conversation. Because the reality is that little HockeyPuck + iTunes has always been just a few revisions away from being a big play  
**2013-06-27T14:39:25+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** Did I miss the asymco one?  
**2013-06-27T14:39:30+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it'll be live  
**2013-06-27T14:39:33+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** aapltradr yup  
**2013-06-27T14:39:52+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** aapltradr: you mean today's Critical Path? yes, we just finished  
**2013-06-27T14:39:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I think an interesting question is, with the few things we all think could make a huge difference (controller API, apps, etc) what has been the hold out?  
**2013-06-27T14:40:01+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** "The Praetorian Guard" should be up soon  
**2013-06-27T14:40:34+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I think there are smart reasons to have held off… but what will be the deciding factor for Apple to cross the Munstericon  
**2013-06-27T14:40:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** (you can use that one)  
**2013-06-27T14:40:55+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** jbecker_: too many syllables for me  
**2013-06-27T14:40:58+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** lol  
**2013-06-27T14:41:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Gene-icon?  
**2013-06-27T14:41:35+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** moiseschiu, too bad - hopefully it´ll be up soon :-)  
**2013-06-27T14:41:39+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** what was the topics?  
**2013-06-27T14:42:02+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Anyway, as a watcher who just wants to be a consumer in the future I just wish that Apple would buy Nintendo and build some really whacky stuff with the ATV :)  
**2013-06-27T14:42:12+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** As a shareholder… ehhhhh  
**2013-06-27T14:42:18+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** asymmetric organizational structure, and Apple's favoring function over the political structure found elsewhere in tech  
**2013-06-27T14:42:45+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** excellent  
**2013-06-27T14:43:00+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** Nintendo would have to be in radically dire straits, and Apple does not own entertainment content, they sell it for others  
**2013-06-27T14:43:32+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** doubtful apple wants to get into owning content  
**2013-06-27T14:43:32+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** to change that would be one of the most fundamental shifts in Apple philosophy since its founding  
**2013-06-27T14:43:41+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** exactly  
**2013-06-27T14:44:10+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** technically, yes, they sell content in the form of first-party apps, but not "entertainment" content  
**2013-06-27T14:44:38+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** a more plausible scenario would be a deeper partnership with say Disney for content  
**2013-06-27T14:46:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** that partnership is as deep as I think they want or can have it be  
**2013-06-27T14:47:49+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** there is some great Apple/Microsoft comparison to be had  
**2013-06-27T14:51:12+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** the secrecy is immense regrading a possible television or a new Apple TV box, so its hard to imagine what sort of content they would offer  
**2013-06-27T14:51:37+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I´m convinced they are aiming for at least UltraHD - and delivery through iTunes with h265  
**2013-06-27T14:51:55+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** but h265 does not appear to be ready yet for Apple  
**2013-06-27T14:52:37+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** Twitter just sent me an email recommending Vine.  Might have been a better idea to sent that last week.  
**2013-06-27T14:54:59+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** Are they making the same mistake with h265 as they did with h264? That prolonged Apple's adoptation and spawned redundant formats like WebM, MKV and DivX  
**2013-06-27T14:56:42+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Oh I agree that Nintendo wouldn't do it and neither would Apple. I just have this fantasy where the best content creators on the planet actually get together with the hardware people. But there's nothing in Apple's culture to understand that software and entertainment can actually be the same  
**2013-06-27T14:57:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** It's just that Nintendo, more than anyone but Apple, really does have this core culture of thinking about hardware and software together in such a deep way  
**2013-06-27T14:57:33+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** there's trouble  
**2013-06-27T14:57:40+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** they just happen to use that culture toward play  
**2013-06-27T15:01:07+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I have a somewhat differing view  
**2013-06-27T15:01:39+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** like in the first "all-new" Screen Time, I'm convinced those rumors of game controller support aren't far off-base  
**2013-06-27T15:02:09+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the current AppleTV uses the same proc architecture as the PSvita  
**2013-06-27T15:02:35+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** which leaves the question of local storage  
**2013-06-27T15:02:58+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** I don't think Nintendo makes bad hardware, they just manufacturing badly positioned hardware. Faulty strategy, not faulty execution.  
**2013-06-27T15:03:17+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** Henrik, agreed  
**2013-06-27T15:03:18+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** their OS on the Wii U is awful, slow, and awful  
**2013-06-27T15:03:28+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** not as slow as it used to be, but slow  
**2013-06-27T15:04:05+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** I think Sony's choice of FreeBSD for PS4 was very enlightened!  
**2013-06-27T15:04:28+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11AC are awesome technologies that would allow an apple tv to really work smoothly with iphone/ipads/macs  
**2013-06-27T15:04:46+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** and with h265 streaming UltraHD would be possible at a decent quality  
**2013-06-27T15:05:06+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** The screen-duplication stuff in the Wii U controller is pretty amazing afaik  
**2013-06-27T15:05:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** UltraHD panel costs are a hurdle  
**2013-06-27T15:05:40+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** for now  
**2013-06-27T15:05:54+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** moiseschiu, no actually they don´t :-)  
**2013-06-27T15:06:14+00:00** - **&lt;_HolyCow&gt;** is this the show?  
**2013-06-27T15:06:23+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** a tease of the show  
**2013-06-27T15:06:32+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** moiseschiu, it´s the upscalers and players that are expensive, and most televisions sets include them. I have seen great UltraHD televisions sold in the US for as low as 1099USD for a 55"  
**2013-06-27T15:06:34+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** UltraHD  
**2013-06-27T15:06:54+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Nintendo has never comfortably made the transition to the OS world. They are at their best when there is no OS, the system is hardware, the game is the software.  
**2013-06-27T15:07:04+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** They never transitions from a world of start menus on a game  
**2013-06-27T15:07:08+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** at least not well  
**2013-06-27T15:07:38+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** But with Apple's interest in sensors, I can't help but to think of gaming as a great way to learn all about them. The accelerometers in the Wiimote was a huge achievement  
**2013-06-27T15:07:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** aapltradr: then show me where these great $1100 TVs are!  
**2013-06-27T15:08:11+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** without an upscaled, doesn't that defeat the usefulness of the TV though?  
**2013-06-27T15:08:41+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-Digital-SE50UY04-50-Inch-120Hz/dp/B00BXF7I9M  
**2013-06-27T15:08:48+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** you can find better deals than this one though  
**2013-06-27T15:09:18+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I saw the Seiki 55" 4K TV for $1099 on ebay from a store. A ton of friends bought them.  
**2013-06-27T15:09:48+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** moiseschiu, not if you have the footage or a 4K player like RedPlayer  
**2013-06-27T15:09:49+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** That's a monitor I could use for my new Mac Pro…  
**2013-06-27T15:10:07+00:00** - **&lt;Henrik|G7&gt;** 50".. my gf would appreciate that  
**2013-06-27T15:11:02+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I make 4K footage for a living  
**2013-06-27T15:11:03+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** aapltradr: the limiting factor is still there being content that takes advantage of it plus hardware to upscale  
**2013-06-27T15:12:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** but you say this TV does have built-in upscaling?  
**2013-06-27T15:13:32+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** Yes, nothing fancy or decent - but if you feed it UHD content it will perfectly  
**2013-06-27T15:13:41+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** play it perfectly  
**2013-06-27T15:14:24+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** Upscaling will never look decent though, it´s like feeding your HD TV a NTSC signal and upscaling it. It never looks nice.  
**2013-06-27T15:15:51+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** thanks for this. didn't know these guys existed  
**2013-06-27T15:16:14+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** you´re welcome  
**2013-06-27T15:17:37+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I have worked with Apple on content before, both advertisements and also for product launches  
**2013-06-27T15:18:14+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I would love if they shook up the television business  
**2013-06-27T15:18:31+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** it's been my assertion for a while that this would be the year  
**2013-06-27T15:19:02+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and I was trying to throw you off the scent with "panel component pricing"  
**2013-06-27T15:19:19+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** any idea who owns Seiki?  
**2013-06-27T15:19:20+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I think the timing is just right both in terms of GPU/CPU, 802.11AC, decent bluetooth 4.0 and a new encoding/decoding standard.  
**2013-06-27T15:21:48+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Are the margins and volumes ever going to be there on big 4k displays to be the ideal way to "disrupt" that sector?  
**2013-06-27T15:22:17+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I'm still of the view that the hockeypuck has far better margins and volume potential (not the least of which is through a regular upgrade path)  
**2013-06-27T15:24:34+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I don't see a TV set eliminating the trojan horse puck  
**2013-06-27T15:24:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** ever  
**2013-06-27T15:25:26+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** yeah I can't imagine that. that's why I'm skeptical about 4k tvs or UHD or whatever being some symbol of Apple movement… they're going to want to piggy back on an existing install base of low-margin equipment someone else made  
**2013-06-27T15:25:49+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I don't think they believe taking a Samsung panel and adding their bezel and software built right in is going to do so much better than the hockeypuck  
**2013-06-27T15:25:56+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** all the HD content in the iTunes Store is delivered to them in ProRes  
**2013-06-27T15:26:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** LG panel  
**2013-06-27T15:26:33+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** that's who they've invested in the most, as I recall  
**2013-06-27T15:26:53+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I'm sure that a beef up of the ATV processor to even just parody w/ next iPad Maxi would give them plenty of room for the juice  
**2013-06-27T15:27:08+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** If Apple release a TV, it would be very different from regular displays - in more ways than software/interface.  
**2013-06-27T15:27:16+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I think they go more powerful than that, with dual GPUs  
**2013-06-27T15:27:53+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** an iSight is a given  
**2013-06-27T15:29:45+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Dual GPUs with lower powered CPU is the way MacPro has gone. But do you need the dual general purpose GPU power for just driving display?  
**2013-06-27T15:30:07+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** only one of the GPU's on Mac Pro drives the display  
**2013-06-27T15:30:08+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** driving display and gaming compute power  
**2013-06-27T15:30:21+00:00** - **&lt;Shinohara&gt;** and the integrated GPU on the new intel proc's will drive a 4k display on it's own  
**2013-06-27T15:30:22+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** moiseschiu so you think it's definitely a big play at gaming to go there  
**2013-06-27T15:30:29+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** they're going to disrupt all of TV based media or won't do it  
**2013-06-27T15:30:31+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** It hink that makes sense. But I still worry about gaming targets on a 10 year device  
**2013-06-27T15:30:32+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** When Apple say the puck is a hobby for them, I don´t think they mean it´s not a big business or a core product - but that it is something they are tinkering with and seriously holding back features/technologies/innovation - and rather have this simple product to get content/backend services working for.  
**2013-06-27T15:32:14+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** At launch of a new category/product they would unveil everything they have been working on at once, and I´m sure it´ll be magical compared to what we are used to today.  
**2013-06-27T15:33:11+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** Like you mentioned last week, SIRI could maybe play role in solving the interfacing problem.  
**2013-06-27T15:33:41+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** the "disruptive" announcement, the "can't innovate" type tough posture, would be to simultaneously shift the paradigm across displays, set-top box, cable, and gaming all at once  
**2013-06-27T15:33:53+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** yep  
**2013-06-27T15:34:37+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** and I'm convinced Apple won't move if they can't at once outdo and under-price them across the board in two forms: the New Puck and the TV  
**2013-06-27T15:35:33+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** CP90 is being edited and should post soon, everyone  
**2013-06-27T15:35:43+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** thanks  
**2013-06-27T15:35:51+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I guess I remain skeptical that they're in position for the TV to be under-priced.  
**2013-06-27T15:36:46+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I do think they have the chops to build somethign like this but have a lot of skepticism about the underlying display market and whether or not people are ready to think of these things as unified and regularly updated devices. I know the puck has to stay… but I don't see the benefit of the unified device other than it fitting Apple ethos  
**2013-06-27T15:36:47+00:00** - **&lt;aapltradr&gt;** I wonder if iAd places some role in that.  
**2013-06-27T15:37:18+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** I almost think of the unified device as the low end choice. Because that's a buyer who is less discerning and wants a 10 year display with some cool stuff that gets updated through software occasionally. The puck becomes the power user device  
**2013-06-27T15:37:37+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** but that's a bit strange because to go "pro" for the device with lower margins is a weird inversion  
**2013-06-27T15:43:04+00:00** - **&lt;moiseschiu&gt;** I gotta run, but leave it here: there's a reason that I'm having these two specific guys in the same way I had Jim and Tom

**2013-06-27T18:32:28+00:00** - **&lt;ian____&gt;** yo!  
**2013-06-27T18:32:33+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** jensimmons: better  
**2013-06-27T18:32:56+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** I think it was just your position relative to the mic at first.  
**2013-06-27T18:33:30+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Dan seems to harp on it :-)  
**2013-06-27T18:36:06+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Man, now I'm regretting having to go to a meeting in an hour :-/  
**2013-06-27T18:36:12+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** This is gonna be a good one  
**2013-06-27T18:47:21+00:00** - **&lt;bravo_sc&gt;** wow  
**2013-06-27T18:47:52+00:00** - **&lt;bravo_sc&gt;** is it over?  
**2013-06-27T18:48:51+00:00** - **&lt;bravo_sc&gt;** i can hear it now :D  
**2013-06-27T19:00:05+00:00** - **&lt;saltybeagle&gt;** prose!  
**2013-06-27T19:06:04+00:00** - **&lt;mfairchild365_&gt;** Kinda new to the party, but it seems like things are written in markdown right now.  Are other formats possible, like html?  
**2013-06-27T19:14:13+00:00** - **&lt;hsunthesql&gt;** I.. love.. this  
**2013-06-27T19:30:10+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** this is the problem i have with a lot of systems using markdown - they seem to encourage blobby content  
**2013-06-27T19:32:48+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** Your Snowfall is a unique snowflake.  
**2013-06-27T19:39:28+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** markdown itself doesn't solve any more problems than blobs of html, it's just nicer to enter and read in raw form  
**2013-06-27T19:43:34+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** !current  
**2013-06-27T19:43:52+00:00** - **&lt;jbecker_&gt;** Guess I'm listenign to this week's Web Ahead based on the chatroom chatter  
**2013-06-27T19:48:38+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** The main downside for the small-scale blog user like me is building + pushing your site, finding a typo, and then having to rebuild the whole thing again to fix it. Of course in a real company someone is supposed to edit the content properly first :)  
**2013-06-27T19:49:43+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** kjhealy: is the build process really painful?  
**2013-06-27T19:50:22+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** adamworrall: No, it's just long (from a sitting-and-waiting point of view) if you have a lot of stuff.  
**2013-06-27T19:50:35+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** I'm using statamic right now, which stores files as yaml and markdown but handles the build process as a cache that updates when you change the content files  
**2013-06-27T19:50:44+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** seems like the best of both worlds  
**2013-06-27T19:51:25+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** adamworrall: Yeah, there are halfway houses that seem to meet that need. I use Octopress.  
**2013-06-27T19:52:02+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** it was definitely an eye opener, though, coming from wordpress  
**2013-06-27T19:52:39+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** adamworrall: I moved ten years worth of stuff over from wordpress.  
**2013-06-27T19:56:29+00:00** - **&lt;adamworrall&gt;** kjhealy: that sounds like a mission and a half  
**2013-06-27T19:58:44+00:00** - **&lt;kjhealy&gt;** adamworrall: It was one of those things where the conversion script you write is good enough 90% of the time, which still leaves hundreds of mistakes to fix.  
**2013-06-27T20:04:06+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** jensimmons: Thanks for another great show. :)  
**2013-06-27T20:04:12+00:00** - **&lt;jensimmons&gt;** :)
