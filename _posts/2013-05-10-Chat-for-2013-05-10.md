**2013-05-10T00:06:40+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Who's on now?  
**2013-05-10T00:07:10+00:00** - **&lt;JorgePasada&gt;** Is it actually live or is that someone forgetting to flip a switch?  
**2013-05-10T04:41:45+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** Is this live or is this the stream?  
**2013-05-10T04:56:34+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** This is not live.  
**2013-05-10T09:46:03+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines_&gt;** hey guys, nothing is live now according to the schedule but the live sign is red  
**2013-05-10T10:07:12+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** ghostlines_: Yeah I noticed, but can't do anything about it unfortunately.  
**2013-05-10T10:15:11+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Shameful  
**2013-05-10T10:16:01+00:00** - *quiesce tacks up signs reading "Vote Røen for light-turner-offer"*  
**2013-05-10T10:17:21+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Haha, thanks ^_^  
**2013-05-10T11:31:54+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** danbenjamin: Hi Dan! The stream is still pretending to be live. Tut-tut!  
**2013-05-10T11:35:38+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Every time I turn the stream on, jsir is ranting about Star Wars.  
**2013-05-10T11:35:43+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Am I having a stroke?  
**2013-05-10T11:40:53+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** You might be in a fugue state.  
**2013-05-10T11:41:37+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Drats. The most precarious of fugues.  
**2013-05-10T11:44:00+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** That's basically what 5by5 is  
**2013-05-10T11:44:32+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** What I didn't say is that I keep it on and listen every time.  
**2013-05-10T11:44:57+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I might be enjoying their pain. Am I a monster?  
**2013-05-10T12:01:33+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I'm really enjoying this playlist with ChipTunes on Spotify, by the way :) http://open.spotify.com/user/bioshinra/playlist/3RhYP7iu0UHKgQ1MD3TOeH  
**2013-05-10T12:04:05+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Chiptunes, my old nemesis.  
**2013-05-10T12:04:16+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** ^_^  
**2013-05-10T12:05:06+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** I tried making some chiptunes recently. Turns out it's pretty hard.  
**2013-05-10T12:05:07+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** ok i'm not crazy, this isn't a live special  
**2013-05-10T12:05:15+00:00** - **&lt;creature&gt;** (Or I'm pretty untalented. Either/or.)  
**2013-05-10T12:05:39+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** the 5by5 mac app tends to start the stream when i log in, no matter what's playing  
**2013-05-10T12:05:42+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Pahonix: It has been set to "live" literally forever.  
**2013-05-10T12:05:47+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Forliterallyever?  
**2013-05-10T12:05:49+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** Yeah, I noticed hehe  
**2013-05-10T12:08:32+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Yeah, it's been "live" all night unfortunately. It would seem like someone forgot to turn it off after the interview with Haddie yesterday.  
**2013-05-10T12:08:46+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** It happens.  
**2013-05-10T12:09:06+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** This is unacceptable.  I demand a refund!  
**2013-05-10T12:09:20+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** "You're fired!"  
**2013-05-10T12:11:17+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** !soundboard  
**2013-05-10T12:11:22+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** That needs to be a thing.  
**2013-05-10T12:11:28+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I'll make it.  
**2013-05-10T12:11:59+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I'm kind of disappointed.  
**2013-05-10T12:14:42+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** there is no !jim either  
**2013-05-10T12:14:49+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Wow.  
**2013-05-10T12:14:56+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** but that would just have varying lengths of "AHAHAHAHAHAHA"  
**2013-05-10T12:15:18+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** The stars at night are big and bright...  
**2013-05-10T12:15:18+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** !texas  
**2013-05-10T12:15:34+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** !bluetoot  
**2013-05-10T12:15:35+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** Before you answer, Hi!  
**2013-05-10T12:17:02+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** !jim needs to link to audio files of explosive laughter.  
**2013-05-10T12:33:49+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Hey Jackals  
**2013-05-10T12:34:13+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Hey!  
**2013-05-10T12:34:16+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Hello  
**2013-05-10T12:34:26+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Everybody got their Jackal-shirts, yet?  
**2013-05-10T12:34:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Ach, self-incrimination.  
**2013-05-10T12:34:46+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I have no shirts.  
**2013-05-10T12:35:04+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** alas, no big&tall sizes are available, so no shirt for me. i need tall :(  
**2013-05-10T12:35:09+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** I might grab one today.  
**2013-05-10T12:35:24+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** I'm waiting for the regular 5by5-branded shirts to come back.  
**2013-05-10T12:35:54+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** At least I've got a mug – http://instagram.com/p/Y89y-wssMN/  
**2013-05-10T12:36:16+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Awesome - I'm drinking some coffee from mine right now ^_^  
**2013-05-10T12:36:22+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** The mug, that is :)  
**2013-05-10T12:38:39+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** I'm about to be! Hopefully the other shirts come back in at some point soon.  
**2013-05-10T12:38:44+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Anyone going to WWDC?  
**2013-05-10T12:43:11+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Good morning Jackals.  
**2013-05-10T12:44:21+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** morning theTiger  
**2013-05-10T12:44:44+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Do you happen to know what the 5by5 Special last night was?  
**2013-05-10T12:45:33+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I do! Haddie was interviewed for a podcast :) I think the special will be released later on 5by5 as well. Make sure you catch the end/the after dark  
**2013-05-10T12:45:39+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Haddie appearing on a thing with a guy called Chris.  
**2013-05-10T12:45:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Sweet. :)  
**2013-05-10T12:46:09+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I was in the dojo when it start and by the time I had gotten back to my phone it was over. :(  
**2013-05-10T12:46:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** started**  
**2013-05-10T12:46:24+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** oh goodie, i have to drive to a party tonight, 1.5hrs each way, need something to listen to  
**2013-05-10T12:47:29+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Pahonix: If you're a fan of After Dark (and more generally 'how sausage is made'), might I recommend http://5by5.tv/afterdark/368 ? :)  
**2013-05-10T12:47:55+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** That one was a very special/strange one.  
**2013-05-10T12:48:32+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Less on the funny (unless you're a big fan of Dan's VERY dry wit); Long on the banter and bizarre.  
**2013-05-10T12:48:56+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** Ooh, some of my favorite tv shows to watch are those "factory made" and "how it's made" on Science  
**2013-05-10T12:48:59+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** so that sounds right up my alley  
**2013-05-10T12:49:05+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** i will definitely check it out, ty  
**2013-05-10T12:49:28+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Haha, the stream is still "live"  
**2013-05-10T12:49:51+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Heh, I've long given up on that status as being accurate. :D  
**2013-05-10T12:50:23+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Well it normally is though - just a few slip-ups here and there  
**2013-05-10T12:50:44+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** AD368 downloaded  
**2013-05-10T12:51:02+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** But, blame Moisés. That one is always his fault. ;-)  
**2013-05-10T12:52:09+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** KimRoen: I think the reason I don't trust it has more to do with the 5by5 OS X app more than anything. I don't think it polls the status of the live light very well.  
**2013-05-10T12:52:17+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Yeah I realized that. Long as Special!  
**2013-05-10T12:52:41+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Long ass*  
**2013-05-10T12:52:42+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** For instance, like when IA or Amplified record mid-day, the little icon in the menu bar will be red for the next 3 or 4 hours. :D  
**2013-05-10T12:53:03+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Moi's fault, Moooi's fault.  
**2013-05-10T12:53:13+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Do you guys like the new 5by5 homepage? With the square show art.  
**2013-05-10T12:53:16+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** theTiger do you have the issue where the app starts the stream when you log in?  
**2013-05-10T12:53:36+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** dylanseeger: Not especially. :) I really miss the show titles on the new episodes.  
**2013-05-10T12:54:09+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Pahonix: No. But… When I launch it and start the stream, Spotify will open on its own. :)  
**2013-05-10T12:54:11+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** theTiger: I miss that too. I really liked the old look.  
**2013-05-10T12:54:38+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** oh hrm, Spotify loads at startup for me, so that's normal.  
**2013-05-10T12:54:40+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** oh i misspoke  
**2013-05-10T12:55:02+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** the stream starts automatically when i use the user-switcher to go to the login window  
**2013-05-10T12:55:07+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** and log back in  
**2013-05-10T12:55:16+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** i do that when i leave for the day  
**2013-05-10T12:55:31+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I don't do that at work since I'm (almost) the only person who uses this machine.  
**2013-05-10T12:56:00+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** i'm the only one that uses my machine, but i work in a shared space  
**2013-05-10T12:57:04+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** i wonder if gruber recorded a talk show this week  
**2013-05-10T12:57:24+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I probably should care more about my security, but I don't. :) The office is keycard-access and everyone on my side of the office has clearance for anything that I would have on my machine anyway,  
**2013-05-10T12:57:42+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** Ah right on  
**2013-05-10T12:57:53+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Though, I'd be curious why they were particularly interested in spreadsheets detailing the procedural errors of my service departments. :D  
**2013-05-10T13:00:41+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** I'm really missing the everyday format of the frequency  
**2013-05-10T13:02:10+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Now that I can actually listen daily, they take it away.  
**2013-05-10T13:02:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** But it's your show.  
**2013-05-10T13:03:03+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** I actually never got into The Frequency  
**2013-05-10T13:03:26+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** It kept the devil dogs at bay.  
**2013-05-10T13:03:30+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** What ever happened to The Crossover, by the way?  
**2013-05-10T13:03:39+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Probably just hard to get guests all the time.  
**2013-05-10T13:03:52+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** We lost a few overs to cross, I should think.  
**2013-05-10T13:04:03+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** Dan almost died, so everything has been a little behind.  
**2013-05-10T13:04:26+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** He hasn't missed a day of work in ten years!  
**2013-05-10T13:04:30+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** He literally figuratively literally had to lie down.  
**2013-05-10T13:04:36+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Perhaps the 70decibels takeover will introduce some new blood to cross.  
**2013-05-10T13:04:39+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Or since he was 13.  
**2013-05-10T13:05:01+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Bionic and CMD+Space have already moved on over.  
**2013-05-10T13:05:28+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** That and Dan seems to be courting literally literally everyone he has on a show, or who has him on their show.  
**2013-05-10T13:05:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Also, OTP (Yeah, you know me) is pretty amazing to listen to. Those guys are passionate and articulate about photography.  
**2013-05-10T13:06:21+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** No idea if that is sincere courting or a play to get the attention of someone special. Peacocking, the kids are calling it.  
**2013-05-10T13:06:36+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** theTiger: Yeah I'm always really impressed when I listen to OTP.  
**2013-05-10T13:06:38+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** quiesce: I figure that he's had a backlog of requests and no time to fulfill them.  
**2013-05-10T13:06:41+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Really great stuff.  
**2013-05-10T13:07:23+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** I've really gotten back into The Critical Path lately, too.  
**2013-05-10T13:07:29+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** TCP is great  
**2013-05-10T13:07:48+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Vastly superior to UDP, KimRoen. ;-)  
**2013-05-10T13:07:51+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** I don't always have the patience to listen to it, but when I do - I always learn something new  
**2013-05-10T13:08:03+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** theTiger: Haha, I thought the exact same thing once I wrote it out ;)  
**2013-05-10T13:08:41+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** I would tell you a UDP joke, but I'm not sure you would get the punchline.  
**2013-05-10T13:09:27+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Wow, HolyCow. Wow.  
**2013-05-10T13:09:36+00:00** - *theTiger stands and slow claps.*  
**2013-05-10T13:09:55+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Holy cow.  
**2013-05-10T13:10:14+00:00** - **&lt;dylanseeger&gt;** Oh, hey! Dan finally put Build and Analyze & Hypercritical into the retired shows section. Closure! :)  
**2013-05-10T13:10:15+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Wow  
**2013-05-10T13:13:07+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** I need help. I just counted how many parody Twitter accounts I have and I am up to 8.  
**2013-05-10T13:13:22+00:00** - **&lt;KimRoen&gt;** Oh-oh.  
**2013-05-10T13:14:36+00:00** - **&lt;Pahonix&gt;** is there a 12-step program for that?  
**2013-05-10T13:14:40+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** dylanseeger: I'm not ready to let go.  
**2013-05-10T13:15:13+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** I'm pretty much over Marco at this point. :) His schtick is tiresome to me.  
**2013-05-10T13:15:23+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** However, I will always miss JSir. :(  
**2013-05-10T13:15:33+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Indeed.  
**2013-05-10T13:17:35+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** I have a sudden (and hopefully fleeting) urge to go full Nimoy and write a song about a brave little cleric named JSir.  
**2013-05-10T13:17:38+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** Go ahead, caller.  
**2013-05-10T13:17:38+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** !merlin  
**2013-05-10T13:18:08+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** quiesce: 10/10 would back on kickstarter  
**2013-05-10T13:19:29+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://davidgalletly.com/storage/artwork/galletly-john-siracusa-illustration.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1353495751840  
**2013-05-10T13:20:18+00:00** - **&lt;quiesce&gt;** Nice, but perhaps he should be "standing on the shoulders of giants".  
**2013-05-10T13:21:55+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** If you could write a song about jsir and then get him to review it I would probably die.  
**2013-05-10T13:22:20+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Didn't he do that in HC 99 or 100?  
**2013-05-10T13:22:58+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Yep, HC 100.  
**2013-05-10T13:23:03+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOyDW_Y2Emo  
**2013-05-10T13:25:52+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** why is there no 5by5-con yet?  
**2013-05-10T13:26:33+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Because Dan can only take so much awkward at once? :)  
**2013-05-10T13:27:01+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** There were the murmurings of a 5by5 Film Fest a while back, but I've not heard anything in a few weeks.  
**2013-05-10T13:31:25+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** there still IS a coal fire under ground at Centralia  
**2013-05-10T13:31:27+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** =)  
**2013-05-10T13:31:56+00:00** - **&lt;theTiger&gt;** Was that an episode of RadioLab? This American Life?  
**2013-05-10T13:32:22+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** whatever is playing on 5by5 live right now  
**2013-05-10T13:32:24+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** I think you're thinking of Silent Hill  
**2013-05-10T13:32:25+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** they were talking about it  
**2013-05-10T13:32:44+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania  
**2013-05-10T13:32:51+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** been there, interesting town, which is not a town anymore  
**2013-05-10T13:33:34+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** the icon was red, so I started listening even though I didn't think anything was live right now  
**2013-05-10T13:33:36+00:00** - **&lt;franksta-imac&gt;** left it on for a while =)

**2013-05-10T17:02:31+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines_&gt;** think I mixed up timezones, quit is starting in an hour ?  
**2013-05-10T17:03:41+00:00** - **&lt;Adam__&gt;** I think so  
**2013-05-10T17:06:34+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines_&gt;** thanks  
**2013-05-10T18:05:51+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** lets quit  
**2013-05-10T18:06:26+00:00** - **&lt;Alan1_&gt;** I'm taking a vacation day to update the old marketing materials. So I can quit.  
**2013-05-10T18:08:49+00:00** - **&lt;CAPSULE&gt;** Let's do this...  
**2013-05-10T18:09:59+00:00** - **&lt;The_Moze&gt;** almost time guyz  
**2013-05-10T18:11:09+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Time to Quit! soon. Use http://t.co/BgFpXUiAZs  to tell us your story. Call in live 512-518-5714 (29 seconds ago)  
**2013-05-10T18:12:38+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines&gt;** how do you call in from outside the US, what's the area code?  
**2013-05-10T18:13:31+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** where are you trying to call from?  
**2013-05-10T18:13:45+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines&gt;** Holland  
**2013-05-10T18:13:48+00:00** - **&lt;CAPSULE&gt;** It is safe to assume I'm on hold, if I don't hear any thing, but my phone doesn't drop?  
**2013-05-10T18:13:59+00:00** - **&lt;Alan1_&gt;** I don't think I've called international before, but I think the country code for the US is 1. So you would just add a 1- to the beginning of the number.  
**2013-05-10T18:14:09+00:00** - **&lt;showbot&gt;** @5by5: Just posted: The Big Web Show 91 with @zeldman - http://t.co/iywZmYsJUz (45 seconds ago)

**2013-05-10T18:15:40+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** CAPSULE: I'm assuming they're just starting a little late. This is the same thing I got last week when I called early.  
**2013-05-10T18:15:40+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines&gt;** cool I'll try that  
**2013-05-10T18:15:59+00:00** - **&lt;CAPSULE&gt;** phil: great, just checking  
**2013-05-10T18:16:07+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** Adam__: hasn't started broadcasting yet. Not as far as I can tell.  
**2013-05-10T18:16:30+00:00** - **&lt;philcrissman&gt;** We should suggest a show title change: LATE!  
**2013-05-10T18:16:35+00:00** - *philcrissman hids*

**2013-05-10T18:20:36+00:00** - **&lt;Alan1_&gt;** I tried to Shazam it, but it couldn't find any matches.  
**2013-05-10T18:20:54+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Dan's a DJ on weekends. Custom mix.  
**2013-05-10T18:20:57+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisDepew&gt;** Quit!  
**2013-05-10T18:21:06+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** QUIT! NICE!  
**2013-05-10T18:21:27+00:00** - **&lt;Russell&gt;** Where does Dan get this music?

**2013-05-10T18:24:44+00:00** - **&lt;ChrisDepew&gt;** I think this is the dance party.  
**2013-05-10T18:24:59+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Haddie, I'm gonna step away for one sec.  
**2013-05-10T18:25:49+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** back  
**2013-05-10T18:25:54+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** Yeah. The Frequency does. But, the've been going through format changes so I'm not sure. Plus, I've never been able to listen to that program live.  
**2013-05-10T18:26:01+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Hey, Brother Gabe!  
**2013-05-10T18:26:17+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** JoshTidBITS: Hey Josh

**2013-05-10T18:26:59+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** I heard 2password is better  
**2013-05-10T18:27:13+00:00** - **&lt;ichris&gt;** 0password is the best one to use. First in the listing.  
**2013-05-10T18:27:14+00:00** - **&lt;ckhicks&gt;** HolyCow: Ha  
**2013-05-10T18:27:40+00:00** - **&lt;Alan1_&gt;** I have this one password that I never remember, but I never screw up on logging in. I think I've managed to store that password in my gut.

**2013-05-10T18:29:22+00:00** - **&lt;ckhicks&gt;** BrGabriel: ftw

**2013-05-10T18:29:53+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** My password is my midi-chlorian count  
**2013-05-10T18:30:07+00:00** - **&lt;agmcleod&gt;** That song reminds me of twitch tv. Was in an ad for al ong time  
**2013-05-10T18:30:09+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** The dingus hung up on me when the show started.

**2013-05-10T18:31:44+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** No one can resist a well dressed dingus  
**2013-05-10T18:31:49+00:00** - **&lt;The_Moze&gt;** !s dan's got a point  
**2013-05-10T18:31:51+00:00** - **&lt;ghostlines&gt;** yeah dress code is tricky, you can never overdress. But a suit isn't always needed in my experience with interviews  
**2013-05-10T18:32:00+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Frank and Oak: For your well-dressed dingus  
**2013-05-10T18:32:09+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** HolyCow: Isn't that a ZZ Top song?  
**2013-05-10T18:32:20+00:00** - **&lt;Beavah&gt;** I've worked in two places where overdressing could cost you the job.  
**2013-05-10T18:32:32+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** !s 60 Minutes, I Promise  
**2013-05-10T18:32:34+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Yeah, some offices freak out at the sight of suit.  
**2013-05-10T18:33:03+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** You're money and you don't even know it.  
**2013-05-10T18:33:13+00:00** - **&lt;bdfortin&gt;** !s That's Money  
**2013-05-10T18:33:17+00:00** - **&lt;scottnelle&gt;** Bought one!  
**2013-05-10T18:33:20+00:00** - **&lt;agmcleod&gt;** Dan, the jackal tshirts, can i get the min canada?  
**2013-05-10T18:33:25+00:00** - **&lt;Beavah&gt;** Personally I believe in dressing at least to the level of the client or other party.  
**2013-05-10T18:33:37+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** The T-shirt looks awesome  
**2013-05-10T18:33:38+00:00** - **&lt;stuartc&gt;** I think you're thinking of Phil Schiller.  
**2013-05-10T18:33:47+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** European Jackal  
**2013-05-10T18:33:54+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** Isn't Canada part of the US?  
**2013-05-10T18:33:58+00:00** - **&lt;agmcleod&gt;** Ah okay. I forgive you guys then!  
**2013-05-10T18:33:59+00:00** - **&lt;abrahamvegh&gt;** Which 5by5 logo will be on the back?  
**2013-05-10T18:34:03+00:00** - **&lt;HolyCow&gt;** Canada is a part of Texas  
**2013-05-10T18:34:12+00:00** - **&lt;scottnelle&gt;** BrGabriel: only if you consider a hat a part of your head  
**2013-05-10T18:34:14+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** HolyCow: Ohhh … right  
**2013-05-10T18:34:32+00:00** - **&lt;BrGabriel&gt;** scottnelle: is that a euphemism?  
**2013-05-10T18:34:35+00:00** - **&lt;hollowshellofama&gt;** I was teased for dressing "up" (not jeans and tshirt) at work. And I wasn't even really that dressy, just business casual.  
**2013-05-10T18:34:38+00:00** - **&lt;CAPSULE&gt;** Shipping to Canada is surprisingly challenging and expensive  
**2013-05-10T18:34:41+00:00** - **&lt;JoshTidBITS&gt;** Wearing a hoodie would be dressing up at my job.
