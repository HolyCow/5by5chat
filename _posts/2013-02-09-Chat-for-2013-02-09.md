**2013-02-09 00:00:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** interesting, they&apos;ve got a $5 monthly membership for the unsure  
**2013-02-09 00:02:33 +0000** - **dsheehy:** MistrG: Stop trying to make App.net happen!  
**2013-02-09 00:02:37 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: well... with 256 character posts, having a longer name isn&apos;t any problem :)  
**2013-02-09 00:02:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: too late... it &ast;is&ast; happening  
**2013-02-09 00:03:18 +0000** - **dsheehy:** is it hip and groovy too?  
**2013-02-09 00:03:30 +0000** - **SuperLag:** quite, if you ask me  
**2013-02-09 00:04:01 +0000** - **dsheehy:** ... just to clrify, if it wasn&apos;t clear, that was a Mean Girls reference  
**2013-02-09 00:04:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** it could easily replace IRC, in terms of functionaltiy... but IRC isn&apos;t going anywhere  
**2013-02-09 00:04:20 +0000** - **dsheehy:** ... nothing against App.net  
**2013-02-09 00:04:23 +0000** - **SuperLag:** it wasn&apos;t clear... never saw that  
**2013-02-09 00:04:41 +0000** - **SuperLag:** are you guys still listening to the feed?  
**2013-02-09 00:04:46 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, that quote works better with references to FTP clients  
**2013-02-09 00:04:47 +0000** - **SuperLag:** if so, who&apos;s talking?  
**2013-02-09 00:06:57 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha dsheehy I&apos;ve been trying to ignore app.net forever  
**2013-02-09 00:06:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** for reference, relevant Mean Girls clip: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sir&#95;24duiF4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sir&#95;24duiF4)  
**2013-02-09 00:07:22 +0000** - **dsheehy:** which is a must-watch movie  
**2013-02-09 00:07:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s like the Citizen Kane of chick-flicks  
**2013-02-09 00:07:51 +0000** - **MistrG:** lindsay lohan&apos;s magnum opus  
**2013-02-09 00:08:28 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: one of the reasons I like it as much as I do... is less noise. No spam bullshit, like on Twitter.  
**2013-02-09 00:08:35 +0000** - **dsheehy:** what I don&apos;t get is why App.net, but not that other Open Source one that I forgot the name of?  
**2013-02-09 00:08:50 +0000** - **SuperLag:** identi.ca ?  
**2013-02-09 00:09:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** nope  
**2013-02-09 00:09:49 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah that was one of the appeals to me superlag, I&apos;ve accumulated like 1700 people that I follow on twitter so my timeline is just a deluge of random thoughts  
**2013-02-09 00:10:20 +0000** - **dsheehy:** like Siracusa said... if you want an alternative to Twitter, why choose another proprietary company?  
**2013-02-09 00:10:29 +0000** - **MistrG:** I suppose  
**2013-02-09 00:10:55 +0000** - **dsheehy:** if you&apos;re going to go for something that nobody uses, why not go all the way and used the Free (as in Freedom) one?  
**2013-02-09 00:11:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** oh, tent.is is what I&apos;m thinking of  
**2013-02-09 00:11:13 +0000** - **MistrG:** right that  
**2013-02-09 00:11:27 +0000** - **MistrG:** I think having a name that sounds like a disease kind of kills your momentum  
**2013-02-09 00:11:32 +0000** - **dsheehy:** although I&apos;m not sure why people want a Twitter or a Twitter akternative  
**2013-02-09 00:11:41 +0000** - **SuperLag:** that&apos;s just a service using ADN, if I understand right  
**2013-02-09 00:11:46 +0000** - **MistrG:** really? huh  
**2013-02-09 00:11:50 +0000** - **dsheehy:** nope  
**2013-02-09 00:11:58 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah I didn&apos;t comprehend the idea of ADN being a lower-level messaging service  
**2013-02-09 00:12:00 +0000** - **dsheehy:** totally different than ADN  
**2013-02-09 00:12:39 +0000** - **dsheehy:** the whole idea seems stupid to me... we already have email and websites, why do people want something as restrictive as Twitter?  
**2013-02-09 00:13:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** well... apparently it&apos;s not stupid :)  
**2013-02-09 00:13:15 +0000** - **dsheehy:** hey, our big features is that YOU CAN&apos;T POST MUCH TEXT! in an age of almost unlimited bandwidth  
**2013-02-09 00:13:23 +0000** - **MistrG:** also I don&apos;t understand the file storage aspect they added to app.net, what&apos;s the purpose?  
**2013-02-09 00:13:37 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: file uploads, photos...  
**2013-02-09 00:14:06 +0000** - **SuperLag:** for the "why" questions... @dalton and @berg are the ones to ask  
**2013-02-09 00:14:24 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh, they&apos;re more familiar?  
**2013-02-09 00:14:31 +0000** - **dsheehy:** SuperLag: which is the really weird thing about Twitter and its clones - people say they like it for its brevity, but then they keep adding cruft to add features because they are so poorly designed  
**2013-02-09 00:14:41 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: they&apos;re the founders :)  
**2013-02-09 00:14:51 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh haha so they might know a thing or two about it  
**2013-02-09 00:14:55 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: and very very approachable  
**2013-02-09 00:14:58 +0000** - **dsheehy:** we already have USENET, FTP, etc  
**2013-02-09 00:15:09 +0000** - **MistrG:** well those are fairly deprecated dsheehy  
**2013-02-09 00:15:31 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: we already had horse and buggy, too... why do we need the automobile? ;)  
**2013-02-09 00:15:33 +0000** - **MistrG:** I guess at a certain level they&apos;re throwing stuff up on the wall to see what sticks  
**2013-02-09 00:15:35 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but they do a better job than craming things onto texting systems  
**2013-02-09 00:16:08 +0000** - **dsheehy:** SuperLag: terrible analogy - USENET, FTP, IRC, websites, etc are way more advanced than Twitter etc  
**2013-02-09 00:16:18 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s like downgrading your technology  
**2013-02-09 00:16:41 +0000** - **SuperLag:** usenet is dead  
**2013-02-09 00:16:49 +0000** - **MistrG:** wait what? didn&apos;t you make the usenet analogy dsheehy?  
**2013-02-09 00:16:50 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, but it was superior  
**2013-02-09 00:16:51 +0000** - **SuperLag:** unless you want to pirate stuff  
**2013-02-09 00:16:55 +0000** - **crucialwax:** usenet seems to be the last to know  
**2013-02-09 00:16:58 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:17:18 +0000** - **MistrG:** I like to think of usenet as an underground colony of molemen  
**2013-02-09 00:17:21 +0000** - **SuperLag:** crucialwax: who uses it for its originally intended purpose?  
**2013-02-09 00:17:40 +0000** - **dsheehy:** It&apos;s just incredibly annoying when superior technologies are replaced with inferior crap that&apos;s used for corporate advertising  
**2013-02-09 00:17:46 +0000** - **SuperLag:** crucialwax: the only context I ever hear references to usenet in, any more, are in reference to piracy  
**2013-02-09 00:18:00 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: but but but.... didn&apos;t you know?  
**2013-02-09 00:18:09 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: marketing makes the world go round!!!!  
**2013-02-09 00:18:14 +0000** - **crucialwax:** i apologize for growing tired of complaining about wil wheaton on usenet. it&apos;s all my fault.  
**2013-02-09 00:18:22 +0000** - **SuperLag:** crucialwax: :D  
**2013-02-09 00:18:47 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh man, wil wheaton  
**2013-02-09 00:18:56 +0000** - **MistrG:** I can feel my blood rising  
**2013-02-09 00:19:00 +0000** - **SuperLag:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:19:05 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: how come&gt;  
**2013-02-09 00:19:06 +0000** - **SuperLag:** ?  
**2013-02-09 00:19:16 +0000** - **crucialwax:** oh. i thought i knew you MistrG !  
**2013-02-09 00:19:21 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:19:27 +0000** - **MistrG:** I dunno, maybe it&apos;s jealousy but his internet celebrity just seems so empty  
**2013-02-09 00:19:45 +0000** - **dsheehy:** silly man, USENET is for complaining about the atheism/athiesm problem  
**2013-02-09 00:19:53 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:19:57 +0000** - **crucialwax:** see. we will need alt.westley.crusher.die.die.die  
**2013-02-09 00:20:07 +0000** - **MistrG:** ah-greed  
**2013-02-09 00:20:18 +0000** - **MistrG:** exactly though, it&apos;s like he plays the character wesley crusher in real life  
**2013-02-09 00:20:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** does he do anything any more? or was NG his only claim to fame?  
**2013-02-09 00:21:05 +0000** - **crucialwax:** he&apos;s written some books  
**2013-02-09 00:21:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** alt.religion.startrek.volcano.virgin.sacrifice  
**2013-02-09 00:21:12 +0000** - **MistrG:** I didn&apos;t know he&apos;d written  
**2013-02-09 00:21:13 +0000** - **crucialwax:** he still acts some  
**2013-02-09 00:21:27 +0000** - **MistrG:** he&apos;s probably kinda in movie jail, everyone knows his face  
**2013-02-09 00:21:30 +0000** - **crucialwax:** he recycle a lot of his blog into books.  
**2013-02-09 00:21:32 +0000** - **crucialwax:** recycled  
**2013-02-09 00:21:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I can just imagine Dan / Haddie reading this tomorrow... and thinking, "what the hell??"  
**2013-02-09 00:21:55 +0000** - **MistrG:** he does that tabletop youtube thing on boardgames  
**2013-02-09 00:21:56 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:22:48 +0000** - **crucialwax:** for some reason, i&apos;m now reading his imdb. he&apos;s been busier than i thought.  
**2013-02-09 00:22:57 +0000** - **crucialwax:** a fair amount of voice acting too  
**2013-02-09 00:23:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** So you guys just come on to IRC for the 5x5 stuff?  
**2013-02-09 00:23:27 +0000** - *SuperLag has been hanging out on IRC for years... I just added this channel to my list in irssi*  
**2013-02-09 00:23:29 +0000** - **crucialwax:** most of us are here all the time. we&apos;re dedicated.  
**2013-02-09 00:23:46 +0000** - **MistrG:** I usually idle on here, this is one of the first few times I&apos;ve actually said much  
**2013-02-09 00:23:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** 16:23 -NickServ(NickServ@services.)- Information on SuperLag (account SuperLag):  
**2013-02-09 00:23:53 +0000** - **SuperLag:** 16:23 -NickServ(NickServ@services.)- Registered : May 09 03:43:54 2003 (9 years, 39 weeks, 5 days, 20:39:39 ago)  
**2013-02-09 00:23:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I come for the snark, and stay for self-pity  
**2013-02-09 00:24:01 +0000** - **MistrG:** ^  
**2013-02-09 00:24:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: LOL  
**2013-02-09 00:24:43 +0000** - **MistrG:** it amazes me that nothing has replaced IRC, there&apos;s still nothing that comes anywhere close to comparing  
**2013-02-09 00:24:58 +0000** - **crucialwax:** there is talking with family  
**2013-02-09 00:25:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** ^^  
**2013-02-09 00:25:04 +0000** - **crucialwax:** er, what?  
**2013-02-09 00:25:09 +0000** - **dsheehy:** long walks on the beach...  
**2013-02-09 00:25:16 +0000** - **dsheehy:** puppies...  
**2013-02-09 00:25:29 +0000** - **dsheehy:** getting caught in the rain...  
**2013-02-09 00:25:50 +0000** - **MistrG:** pina coladas...  
**2013-02-09 00:26:07 +0000** - **crucialwax:** getting caught in the rain  
**2013-02-09 00:26:40 +0000** - **dsheehy:** would you like making love at midnight?  
**2013-02-09 00:26:55 +0000** - **MistrG:** gonna take me to dinner first?  
**2013-02-09 00:26:57 +0000** - **crucialwax:** in the dunes on the cape  
**2013-02-09 00:27:04 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I don&apos;t usually listen to the live feed. I listened today because I was wondering if Dan would end up reading my email or not.  
**2013-02-09 00:27:27 +0000** - **SuperLag:** Then I just figured it might make feedback easier if I said it was me.  
**2013-02-09 00:27:28 +0000** - **MistrG:** I like the livefeed, it&apos;s interesting to see what forethought goes into the show  
**2013-02-09 00:27:33 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Come with me and escape!  
**2013-02-09 00:27:47 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I figured everyone would slam me, and tell me I was scum...  
**2013-02-09 00:27:55 +0000** - **MistrG:** which was yours superlag?  
**2013-02-09 00:27:58 +0000** - **SuperLag:** there was a little snark, at first  
**2013-02-09 00:28:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** wait, you aren&apos;t scum?  
**2013-02-09 00:28:14 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: :)  
**2013-02-09 00:28:17 +0000** - **MistrG:** this is after all a hive of scum and villainy  
**2013-02-09 00:28:20 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: the last one, about the guy with felony record  
**2013-02-09 00:28:23 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh right  
**2013-02-09 00:28:26 +0000** - **crucialwax:** just plays scum on the internet  
**2013-02-09 00:28:38 +0000** - **MistrG:** that was a great one, good on you for bringing it up  
**2013-02-09 00:28:46 +0000** - **crucialwax:** hmm. i missed most of that one.  
**2013-02-09 00:29:25 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I really do have a good gig. I just want to move from support into dev.  
**2013-02-09 00:29:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** the concept of trust in a workplace is a big one  
**2013-02-09 00:29:42 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah fighting fires constantly sucks, especially when they&apos;re basically the same fire over and over and over  
**2013-02-09 00:29:57 +0000** - **SuperLag:** well... I&apos;d done work for the contract agency that placed me with them, before I ever went to prison  
**2013-02-09 00:30:14 +0000** - **SuperLag:** and I guess they figured since I already had good history, I didn&apos;t get the vetting that was normal  
**2013-02-09 00:30:40 +0000** - **SuperLag:** and I&apos;d ended up working at my employer&apos;s office for ~2 years before they offered to bring me on full time  
**2013-02-09 00:30:54 +0000** - **SuperLag:** and when that came up... that&apos;s when I had the talk with the boss about it  
**2013-02-09 00:30:55 +0000** - **MistrG:** right yeah  
**2013-02-09 00:30:59 +0000** - **SuperLag:** he didn&apos;t believe me!  
**2013-02-09 00:31:11 +0000** - **MistrG:** how so  
**2013-02-09 00:31:16 +0000** - **MistrG:** didn&apos;t believe you&apos;d be trustworthy?  
**2013-02-09 00:31:28 +0000** - **SuperLag:** no, he didn&apos;t believe that I&apos;d been in trouble and had a record  
**2013-02-09 00:31:36 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh haha  
**2013-02-09 00:31:38 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I told him I wouldn&apos;t joke about something like that  
**2013-02-09 00:31:47 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah no doubt  
**2013-02-09 00:32:14 +0000** - **SuperLag:** he said, "well, you&apos;ve done excellent work... and there haven&apos;t been any behavioral or work ethic issues. I&apos;m not making any promises, but I&apos;ll see what I can do."  
**2013-02-09 00:32:46 +0000** - **dsheehy:** so, were you hard up for money, or was the CC thing more out of boredom/a challenge?  
**2013-02-09 00:33:00 +0000** - **SuperLag:** lot of circumstances there  
**2013-02-09 00:33:05 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah I&apos;m really curious about how you got into that, I was trying to find the right way to ask  
**2013-02-09 00:33:07 +0000** - **SuperLag:** not that it excuses any of it  
**2013-02-09 00:33:30 +0000** - **SuperLag:** first wife cleaned me out.  
**2013-02-09 00:33:44 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I used her creds to get credit under false pretenses.  
**2013-02-09 00:33:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** went on a shopping spree  
**2013-02-09 00:34:00 +0000** - **dsheehy:** judging character is really difficult, especially when all you have to go on is paper records  
**2013-02-09 00:34:10 +0000** - **SuperLag:** to replace all she took from me  
**2013-02-09 00:34:13 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: agreed  
**2013-02-09 00:34:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** credit cards are the worst  
**2013-02-09 00:34:41 +0000** - **MistrG:** aw man, so she knew who it was immediately I&apos;m guessing  
**2013-02-09 00:34:47 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it seems like getting near one is poison for everybody except the banks  
**2013-02-09 00:35:11 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: they&apos;re a tool. Used properly, they can be very helpful.  
**2013-02-09 00:35:15 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah kind of disgusting that they&apos;re so accepted as being normal  
**2013-02-09 00:35:50 +0000** - **dsheehy:** rehabilitation is a very tricky acience/art  
**2013-02-09 00:35:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;science  
**2013-02-09 00:35:56 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: and at least in the US, you have a hard time doing any major purchases (house, car) without some sort of credit history established  
**2013-02-09 00:36:07 +0000** - **MistrG:** right, it&apos;s that way in canada as well  
**2013-02-09 00:36:26 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: are you from the US?  
**2013-02-09 00:36:30 +0000** - **crucialwax:** house purchase is probably the easiest. they&apos;ll just take the house.  
**2013-02-09 00:36:33 +0000** - **dsheehy:** SuperLag: yeah, I feel that - going into debt actually establishes your credit record!  
**2013-02-09 00:36:42 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: it&apos;s stupid  
**2013-02-09 00:36:51 +0000** - **MistrG:** it&apos;s mostly interest rates on credit cards that get me, I keep thinking of sopranos " you&apos;re paying points on that"  
**2013-02-09 00:36:56 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: but no, you don&apos;t have to incur debt to do it  
**2013-02-09 00:37:11 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I had no idea - I never had a credit card until I was like 30, and wondered why nobody would give me a loan  
**2013-02-09 00:37:17 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: charge some things, pay it off at the end of the month  
**2013-02-09 00:37:24 +0000** - **dsheehy:** rack up some CC debt, and they start making offers  
**2013-02-09 00:38:21 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but as for the criminal record stuff, that also is really hard  
**2013-02-09 00:38:39 +0000** - **SuperLag:** well... you want to talk about establishing good credit... having criminal fraud on your credit profile, it doesn&apos;t get any worse than that  
**2013-02-09 00:38:51 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh man hadn&apos;t thought of that  
**2013-02-09 00:39:00 +0000** - **SuperLag:** when I said I&apos;ve busted my ass to get where I am now... I wasn&apos;t kidding  
**2013-02-09 00:39:04 +0000** - **dsheehy:** for example, I used to shoplift like a motherfucker when I was a teenager - but after I was caught, I couldn&apos;t be more straight-laced  
**2013-02-09 00:39:05 +0000** - **SuperLag:** we have a house now  
**2013-02-09 00:39:09 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I have a good job  
**2013-02-09 00:39:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I won&apos;t even let a cashier give me 10 cents extra in change now  
**2013-02-09 00:39:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** did you get a mortgage for your house or did you have to build up a huge amount of cash?  
**2013-02-09 00:39:43 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: mortgage  
**2013-02-09 00:40:13 +0000** - **MistrG:** ah, good that you weren&apos;t completely cut off from credit  
**2013-02-09 00:40:19 +0000** - **dsheehy:** but some people are recidivists... so how does a potential employer know someone who won&apos;t ever offend again from someone who will always be that way?  
**2013-02-09 00:40:29 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: the overseas assignment for my employer was &ast;&ast;VERY&ast;&ast; lucrative. So it put is in the position of being &#95;almost&#95; to the point of doing a conventional loan  
**2013-02-09 00:40:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: good question  
**2013-02-09 00:41:03 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: the stats say ~90% reoffend  
**2013-02-09 00:41:40 +0000** - **dsheehy:** some people live for most of their lives never breaking the smallest law, and then just crack and murder a bunch of people  
**2013-02-09 00:41:49 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: 3 years of prison was enough to make me do &ast;whatever it took&ast; to complete my parole successfully, and never go back, ever again  
**2013-02-09 00:41:52 +0000** - **SuperLag:** and I did  
**2013-02-09 00:41:58 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I am part of that 10%.  
**2013-02-09 00:42:08 +0000** - **MistrG:** holy shit, 3 years? wow  
**2013-02-09 00:42:10 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yup  
**2013-02-09 00:42:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** that&apos;s a shocker  
**2013-02-09 00:42:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** was it minimum security?  
**2013-02-09 00:42:41 +0000** - **MistrG:** what was your life in jail like? were you able to use computers, etc?  
**2013-02-09 00:42:51 +0000** - **dsheehy:** not like Alcatraz or anything?  
**2013-02-09 00:43:27 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: then the loan officer said... you have 3 debts that will keep you from buying this house. Pay them off.  
**2013-02-09 00:43:54 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: then when I did that, we couldn&apos;t do a conventional loan any more... so we did an FHA loan, which was 3% down  
**2013-02-09 00:44:06 +0000** - **MistrG:** ah  
**2013-02-09 00:44:33 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: all ranges... you start out in Maximum security, so they can classify you, what kind of risk you are/aren&apos;t... then you get moved accordingly  
**2013-02-09 00:45:06 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: I ended up being put in Medium, because they considered me a flight risk, since I was a fugitive for some time  
**2013-02-09 00:45:07 +0000** - **MistrG:** interesting  
**2013-02-09 00:45:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh wow, that must have been a insanely stressful point in your life  
**2013-02-09 00:45:31 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: paying off those debts... and getting the mortgage... it completely turned my credit around  
**2013-02-09 00:45:45 +0000** - **SuperLag:** MistrG: very  
**2013-02-09 00:45:57 +0000** - **SuperLag:** no amount of money is worth the terrors of prison  
**2013-02-09 00:46:00 +0000** - **dsheehy:** you should put "fugitive" on your business card... it sounds badass  
**2013-02-09 00:46:08 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I think not.  
**2013-02-09 00:46:13 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:46:15 +0000** - **dsheehy:** although the reality probably isn&apos;t so cool  
**2013-02-09 00:46:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** like, did you swap faces with another guy?  
**2013-02-09 00:46:40 +0000** - **SuperLag:** No... the lifestyle of always having to look over your shoulder, it messes with your head  
**2013-02-09 00:46:47 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: o.O  
**2013-02-09 00:46:54 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:47:16 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah in my mind a fugitive starts by swapping faces with john travolta (very covert)  
**2013-02-09 00:47:16 +0000** - **dsheehy:** see how much easier life would be if you&apos;re living in a movie?  
**2013-02-09 00:47:41 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and people wonder why actors become Scientologists  
**2013-02-09 00:47:50 +0000** - **SuperLag:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:47:56 +0000** - **SuperLag:** No... life is good now.  
**2013-02-09 00:47:59 +0000** - **SuperLag:** VERY good  
**2013-02-09 00:48:01 +0000** - **MistrG:** glad to hear it  
**2013-02-09 00:48:13 +0000** - **SuperLag:** My wife almost didn&apos;t marry me though...  
**2013-02-09 00:48:20 +0000** - **SuperLag:** when we were courting... I told her EVERYTHING  
**2013-02-09 00:48:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** that&apos;s the only way no doubt  
**2013-02-09 00:48:40 +0000** - **SuperLag:** and she came from a very old-fashioned and traditional family  
**2013-02-09 00:48:53 +0000** - **SuperLag:** she was like... "Yeah, nice talking to you. Thanks, but no thanks."  
**2013-02-09 00:49:19 +0000** - **MistrG:** heh no doubt  
**2013-02-09 00:49:24 +0000** - **SuperLag:** I wish I would have met her at 19... but it wouldn&apos;t have been very nice to introduce her to the 19-year-old me.  
**2013-02-09 00:49:25 +0000** - **dsheehy:** did you have to ask her father for her hand?  
**2013-02-09 00:49:27 +0000** - **MistrG:** an uphill romance I bet  
**2013-02-09 00:49:41 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: no, but I did anyways  
**2013-02-09 00:49:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s always a good test - if the father comes back to you with her hand in a jar, probably not a good sign  
**2013-02-09 00:50:04 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:50:32 +0000** - **SuperLag:** dsheehy: you&apos;re odd... just in case you didn&apos;t know already  
**2013-02-09 00:50:40 +0000** - **SuperLag:** :)  
**2013-02-09 00:50:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Me? Never.  
**2013-02-09 00:51:21 +0000** - **MistrG:** it&apos;s an important thing to look out for  
**2013-02-09 00:51:34 +0000** - **MistrG:** gotta benchmark the inlaws before making them production  
**2013-02-09 00:51:43 +0000** - **SuperLag:** lol  
**2013-02-09 00:51:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** sudo touch parents  
**2013-02-09 00:52:18 +0000** - **SuperLag:** we had a baby girl when I was still over in Europe  
**2013-02-09 00:52:26 +0000** - **SuperLag:** she&apos;ll be 1 on the 21st  
**2013-02-09 00:52:34 +0000** - **SuperLag:** this year has flown by  
**2013-02-09 00:53:07 +0000** - **MistrG:** wow, congrats  
**2013-02-09 00:53:12 +0000** - **MistrG:** what&apos;d you name her?  
**2013-02-09 00:53:17 +0000** - **SuperLag:** Chloe  
**2013-02-09 00:53:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** hey, nice work on spelling the name normally  
**2013-02-09 00:54:05 +0000** - **dsheehy:** these days, I&apos;d expect that to have several Zs and a fewYs  
**2013-02-09 00:54:36 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:55:05 +0000** - **SuperLag:** A. B. C.  
**2013-02-09 00:55:05 +0000** - **MistrG:** I think a kid&apos;s name is a big deal  
**2013-02-09 00:55:12 +0000** - **SuperLag:** Aaron. Brenda. Chloe.  
**2013-02-09 00:55:21 +0000** - **SuperLag:** we&apos;re silly that way  
**2013-02-09 00:55:28 +0000** - **SuperLag:** the next kid will be a "D"  
**2013-02-09 00:55:52 +0000** - **MistrG:** this satisfies my inner nerd  
**2013-02-09 00:55:59 +0000** - **SuperLag:** she just started walking, unassisted, two days ago  
**2013-02-09 00:56:03 +0000** - **dsheehy:** well, at least it&apos;s not Kim, Kourteny, Khloe and Snooki  
**2013-02-09 00:56:07 +0000** - **SuperLag:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:56:09 +0000** - **MistrG:** lol indeed  
**2013-02-09 00:56:34 +0000** - **MistrG:** seriously though having a name that is easy to write and pronounce is a defining part of a kid&apos;s life  
**2013-02-09 00:57:21 +0000** - **MistrG:** my name is Gareth and it&apos;s been the bane of my young existence haha  
**2013-02-09 00:57:36 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I think I&apos;m going to name my child Onomatopoeia  
**2013-02-09 00:57:39 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:57:51 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it sounds exactly like it&apos;s spelt!  
**2013-02-09 00:57:53 +0000** - **MistrG:** name them the noise a door makes when it slams  
**2013-02-09 00:58:13 +0000** - **dsheehy:** or Seven  
**2013-02-09 00:58:17 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 00:58:24 +0000** - **dsheehy:** it&apos;s Micky Mantle&apos;s number!  
**2013-02-09 00:58:30 +0000** - **MistrG:** "my name is 7even"  
**2013-02-09 00:58:51 +0000** - **SuperLag:** haha  
**2013-02-09 01:00:13 +0000** - **dsheehy:** My Hobby: Pronouncing numerals in movie/book titles where numerals are used to replace letters  
**2013-02-09 01:01:32 +0000** - **dsheehy:** also, this:

**2013-02-09 01:03:16 +0000** - **dsheehy:** holy shit, I just forgot about this one, too:  
**2013-02-09 01:03:19 +0000** - **dsheehy:** [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gODZzSOelss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gODZzSOelss)  
**2013-02-09 01:06:21 +0000** - **dsheehy:** [dolphin noise], San Diego State University  
**2013-02-09 01:08:12 +0000** - **SuperLag:** xkcd is hilarious  
**2013-02-09 01:09:05 +0000** - **MistrG:** holy shit I forgot about this K&P, amazing  
**2013-02-09 01:09:27 +0000** - **dsheehy:** are Key & Peele coming back, or are they done?  
**2013-02-09 01:09:41 +0000** - **MistrG:** they&apos;re still going I thought? just working on season 3  
**2013-02-09 01:09:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** whew.  
**2013-02-09 01:10:11 +0000** - **MistrG:** I&apos;d start flipping tables if they were done  
**2013-02-09 01:10:20 +0000** - **MistrG:** it seems like they only just hit their stride with season 2  
**2013-02-09 01:10:39 +0000** - **SuperLag:** Okay. Time for me to split.  
**2013-02-09 01:10:47 +0000** - **MistrG:** adios  
**2013-02-09 01:10:50 +0000** - **MistrG:** good talking to you  
**2013-02-09 01:10:51 +0000** - **dsheehy:** is it racist for a white guy to have an exceptional love for Chappelle&apos;s Show and K&P?  
**2013-02-09 01:11:07 +0000** - **dsheehy:** see you SuperLag  
**2013-02-09 01:11:13 +0000** - **SuperLag:** It&apos;s good talking with you guys. Thank you for the understanding, and not treating me like scum... you&apos;d be surprised how people&apos;s views change, if they hear of your history  
**2013-02-09 01:11:16 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh you should call into quit next week, you gotta give more context on your situation - lots to talk about  
**2013-02-09 01:11:43 +0000** - **dsheehy:** well, just remember, just because we don&apos;t treat you like scum doesn&apos;t mean you aren&apos;t.  
**2013-02-09 01:11:49 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 01:12:31 +0000** - **dsheehy:** take care  
**2013-02-09 01:13:33 +0000** - **MistrG:** whoa I had no idea but apparently key & peele were both on madtv  
**2013-02-09 01:14:00 +0000** - **MistrG:** and yeah they are doing atleast a 3rd season [http://www.seat42f.com/comedy-central-renews-key-peele-for-a-third-season.html](http://www.seat42f.com/comedy-central-renews-key-peele-for-a-third-season.html)  
**2013-02-09 01:14:34 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, when I started watching I thought "these guys look familiar" but it took me a few episodes to realise it was "Coach" from Mad TV and the other guy  
**2013-02-09 01:14:58 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Mad TV is also extremely under-rated  
**2013-02-09 01:15:04 +0000** - **MistrG:** absolutely  
**2013-02-09 01:15:16 +0000** - **joacim:** mad tv is one of those sketch shows?  
**2013-02-09 01:15:22 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I don&apos;t know what they were thinking when they essentially replaced it with that MAD animated show  
**2013-02-09 01:15:25 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah it was  
**2013-02-09 01:15:30 +0000** - **dsheehy:** like SNL  
**2013-02-09 01:15:37 +0000** - **MistrG:** but infinitely better  
**2013-02-09 01:15:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** often better than SNL during its run  
**2013-02-09 01:16:01 +0000** - **joacim:** i can just barely remember in living color  
**2013-02-09 01:16:13 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah it was funnier than SNL and also it died when it was dead, rather than turning into a tax-writeoff zombie like SNL  
**2013-02-09 01:16:18 +0000** - **joacim:** that aired once in a while on afternoons after school  
**2013-02-09 01:16:33 +0000** - **dsheehy:** In iving Color was pretty good  
**2013-02-09 01:16:46 +0000** - **dsheehy:** or was it Colour?  
**2013-02-09 01:16:56 +0000** - **dsheehy:** wasn&apos;t it Canadian or something?  
**2013-02-09 01:17:20 +0000** - **joacim:** i thought it was colour at first, but google hits says color.  
**2013-02-09 01:17:28 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah it&apos;d be colour if it was canadian  
**2013-02-09 01:17:30 +0000** - **dsheehy:** hmmmm  
**2013-02-09 01:17:52 +0000** - **MistrG:** might be thninking of kids in the hall  
**2013-02-09 01:18:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I think you might be thinking of Parker Lewis Can&apos;t Lose  
**2013-02-09 01:19:53 +0000** - **dsheehy:** people are so dismissive of sketch comedy... when in reality it&apos;s one of the most creative art forms around  
**2013-02-09 01:20:04 +0000** - **MistrG:** absolutely  
**2013-02-09 01:20:08 +0000** - **MistrG:** though it can be very hit or miss  
**2013-02-09 01:20:27 +0000** - **MistrG:** which is kind of in it&apos;s nature though  
**2013-02-09 01:20:29 +0000** - **dsheehy:** yeah, but that&apos;s why it&apos;s so creative  
**2013-02-09 01:20:52 +0000** - **dsheehy:** while with scripted stuff, they often seem to be trying very hard to polish a turd  
**2013-02-09 01:21:03 +0000** - **MistrG:** yeah  
**2013-02-09 01:21:12 +0000** - **dsheehy:** with improv/sketches, you get a turd and just flush it  
**2013-02-09 01:22:08 +0000** - **dsheehy:** speaking of which...  
**2013-02-09 01:26:36 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 01:27:06 +0000** - **MistrG:** time to take care of lunch waste and sort out dinner  
**2013-02-09 01:28:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** cool, good luck writing your next musical, MistrG  
**2013-02-09 01:28:50 +0000** - **MistrG:** haha  
**2013-02-09 01:29:03 +0000** - **MistrG:** my next and first musical

**2013-02-09 01:33:25 +0000** - **MistrG:** I am not actually, Mister G is something my dad called me when I was young  
**2013-02-09 01:33:29 +0000** - **MistrG:** I have no idea what summer heights high  
**2013-02-09 01:33:36 +0000** - **MistrG:** is

**2013-02-09 01:36:08 +0000** - **MistrG:** holy shit  
**2013-02-09 01:36:23 +0000** - **dsheehy:** or the horribly blurry, condensed version : [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubTs&#95;VcO4Q4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubTs&#95;VcO4Q4)  
**2013-02-09 01:36:36 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I know, right?  
**2013-02-09 01:36:40 +0000** - **MistrG:** this is incredible  
**2013-02-09 01:37:10 +0000** - **MistrG:** clearly, anorexia is a hard road  
**2013-02-09 01:37:14 +0000** - **MistrG:** you can tell from his hips  
**2013-02-09 01:37:48 +0000** - **MistrG:** torrenting the first season of this  
**2013-02-09 01:38:00 +0000** - **MistrG:** is there only the one?  
**2013-02-09 01:38:09 +0000** - **dsheehy:** this actor, Chris Lilley is amazing  
**2013-02-09 01:38:19 +0000** - **MistrG:** lmao the exercise ball  
**2013-02-09 01:38:29 +0000** - **dsheehy:** he plays several roles in each episodes, including teenage girls, etc  
**2013-02-09 01:38:34 +0000** - **MistrG:** he keeps an amazingly straight face  
**2013-02-09 01:38:50 +0000** - **dsheehy:** there&apos;s one season, but he has other similar shows  
**2013-02-09 01:39:34 +0000** - **dsheehy:** We Can be Heroes was his first  
**2013-02-09 01:39:36 +0000** - **MistrG:** the only reason you know this isn&apos;t real is because actual students would be losing their shit  
**2013-02-09 01:39:58 +0000** - **dsheehy:** then he did Summer Heights, then Angry Boys  
**2013-02-09 01:40:59 +0000** - **dsheehy:** I know the "popular blonde girl" from Summer Heights, she performed in our theatre a few times  
**2013-02-09 01:41:11 +0000** - **MistrG:** awesome I got it right, it was about anorexia  
**2013-02-09 01:41:23 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh cool  
**2013-02-09 01:41:40 +0000** - **MistrG:** where abouts in australia are you?  
**2013-02-09 01:42:06 +0000** - **dsheehy:** the depiction of Australian life in all of these shows, while insanely over-the-top, is also disturbingly realistic  
**2013-02-09 01:42:14 +0000** - **dsheehy:** Melbourne  
**2013-02-09 01:42:54 +0000** - **dsheehy:** oh, not just anorexia, he writes a musical about a student from the school who dies from an ecstasy overdose  
**2013-02-09 01:43:28 +0000** - **dsheehy:** thing is, just after the show premiered, there was a major scandal with a Syndney schoolgirl dying from an ecstasy overdose  
**2013-02-09 01:43:57 +0000** - **dsheehy:** so, it was pretty controversial and widely dissed by the moral guardians/busybodies  
**2013-02-09 01:44:10 +0000** - **dsheehy:** even though it was made before that girl&apos;s death  
**2013-02-09 01:44:20 +0000** - **MistrG:** oh man  
**2013-02-09 01:44:49 +0000** - **MistrG:** you&apos;re just screwed in that case  
**2013-02-09 01:45:38 +0000** - **dsheehy:** &ast;The more you know&ast;  
**2013-02-09 01:45:53 +0000** - **MistrG:** it&apos;s like that groupon for concealed weapon training just after sandy hook, even if it is a coincidence nopenopenope  
**2013-02-09 01:46:34 +0000** - **dsheehy:** anyway, I think we both have to get going - just make sure you watch those three series!  
**2013-02-09 01:46:42 +0000** - **dsheehy:** and write a report!  
**2013-02-09 01:46:50 +0000** - **MistrG:** there will be a test  
**2013-02-09 01:47:00 +0000** - **MistrG:** take care  
**2013-02-09 01:47:08 +0000** - **dsheehy:** indeed... and you won;t know when the test will be

**2013-02-09 15:50:08 +0000** - **Vlot:** esusatyo: Yeah, during the night seems like a good idea to me. And like the person who wrote an answer said, if it receives a push notification it &ast;does&ast; have an internet connection. You can&apos;t rely on the push notification initiated download as the only way to download content though. If there is new content when the user launches the app, it should download it then, too.
